My name is Roderigo.RODERIGO
The worser welcome:BRABANTIO
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:BRABANTIO
In honest plainness thou hast heard me sayBRABANTIO
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madnessBRABANTIO
Being full of supper and distempering draughtsBRABANTIO
Upon malicious bravery dost thou comeBRABANTIO
To start my quiet.BRABANTIO
Sir sir sir--RODERIGO
                  But thou must needs be sureBRABANTIO
My spirit and my place have in them powerBRABANTIO
To make this bitter to thee.BRABANTIO
Patience good sir.RODERIGO
What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;BRABANTIO
My house is not a grange.BRABANTIO
Most grave BrabantioRODERIGO
In simple and pure soul I come to you.RODERIGO
'Zounds sir you are one of those that will notIAGO
serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come toIAGO
do you service and you think we are ruffians you'llIAGO
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;IAGO
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll haveIAGO
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.IAGO
What profane wretch art thou?BRABANTIO
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughterIAGO
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.IAGO
Thou art a villain.BRABANTIO
You are--a senator.IAGO
This thou shalt answer; I know thee Roderigo.BRABANTIO
Sir I will answer any thing. But I beseech youRODERIGO
If't be your pleasure and most wise consentRODERIGO
As partly I find it is that your fair daughterRODERIGO
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the nightRODERIGO
Transported with no worse nor better guardRODERIGO
But with a knave of common hire a gondolierRODERIGO
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--RODERIGO
If this be known to you and your allowanceRODERIGO
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;RODERIGO
But if you know not this my manners tell meRODERIGO
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believeRODERIGO
That from the sense of all civilityRODERIGO
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:RODERIGO
Your daughter if you have not given her leaveRODERIGO
I say again hath made a gross revolt;RODERIGO
Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunesRODERIGO
In an extravagant and wheeling strangerRODERIGO
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:RODERIGO
If she be in her chamber or your houseRODERIGO
Let loose on me the justice of the stateRODERIGO
For thus deluding you.RODERIGO
Strike on the tinder ho!BRABANTIO
Give me a taper! call up all my people!BRABANTIO
This accident is not unlike my dream:BRABANTIO
Belief of it oppresses me already.BRABANTIO
Light I say! light!BRABANTIO
Farewell; for I must leave you:IAGO
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my placeIAGO
To be produced--as if I stay I shall--IAGO
Against the Moor: for I do know the stateIAGO
However this may gall him with some chequeIAGO
Cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'dIAGO
With such loud reason to the Cyprus warsIAGO
Which even now stand in act that for their soulsIAGO
Another of his fathom they have noneIAGO
To lead their business: in which regardIAGO
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.IAGO
Yet for necessity of present lifeIAGO
I must show out a flag and sign of loveIAGO
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find himIAGO
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;IAGO
And there will I be with him. So farewell.IAGO
It is too true an evil: gone she is;BRABANTIO
And what's to come of my despised timeBRABANTIO
Is nought but bitterness. Now RoderigoBRABANTIO
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!BRABANTIO
With the Moor say'st thou? Who would be a father!BRABANTIO
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives meBRABANTIO
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:BRABANTIO
Raise all my kindred. Are they married think you?BRABANTIO
Truly I think they are.RODERIGO
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!BRABANTIO
Fathers from hence trust not your daughters' mindsBRABANTIO
By what you see them act. Is there not charmsBRABANTIO
By which the property of youth and maidhoodBRABANTIO
May be abused? Have you not read RoderigoBRABANTIO
Of some such thing?BRABANTIO
Yes sir I have indeed.RODERIGO
Call up my brother. O would you had had her!BRABANTIO
Some one way some another. Do you knowBRABANTIO
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?BRABANTIO
I think I can discover him if you pleaseRODERIGO
To get good guard and go along with me.RODERIGO
Pray you lead on. At every house I'll call;BRABANTIO
I may command at most. Get weapons ho!BRABANTIO
And raise some special officers of night.BRABANTIO
On good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.BRABANTIO
Though in the trade of war I have slain menIAGO
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscienceIAGO
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquityIAGO
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten timesIAGO
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.IAGO
'Tis better as it is.OTHELLO
Nay but he pratedIAGO
And spoke such scurvy and provoking termsIAGO
Against your honourIAGO
That with the little godliness I haveIAGO
I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you sirIAGO
Are you fast married? Be assured of thisIAGO
That the magnifico is much belovedIAGO
And hath in his effect a voice potentialIAGO
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;IAGO
Or put upon you what restraint and grievanceIAGO
The law with all his might to enforce it onIAGO
Will give him cable.IAGO
Let him do his spite:OTHELLO
My services which I have done the signioryOTHELLO
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know--OTHELLO
Which when I know that boasting is an honourOTHELLO
I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and beingOTHELLO
From men of royal siege and my demeritsOTHELLO
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortuneOTHELLO
As this that I have reach'd: for know IagoOTHELLO
But that I love the gentle DesdemonaOTHELLO
I would not my unhoused free conditionOTHELLO
Put into circumscription and confineOTHELLO
For the sea's worth. But look! what lights come yond?OTHELLO
Those are the raised father and his friends:IAGO
You were best go in.IAGO
Not I	I must be found:OTHELLO
My parts my title and my perfect soulOTHELLO
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?OTHELLO
By Janus I think no.IAGO
The servants of the duke and my lieutenant.OTHELLO
The goodness of the night upon you friends!OTHELLO
What is the news?OTHELLO
                  The duke does greet you generalCASSIO
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearanceCASSIO
Even on the instant.CASSIO
What is the matter think you?OTHELLO
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:CASSIO
It is a business of some heat: the galleysCASSIO
Have sent a dozen sequent messengersCASSIO
This very night at one another's heelsCASSIO
And many of the consuls raised and metCASSIO
Are at the duke's already: you have beenCASSIO
hotly call'd for;CASSIO
When being not at your lodging to be foundCASSIO
The senate hath sent about three several guestsCASSIO
To search you out.CASSIO
'Tis well I am found by you.OTHELLO
I will but spend a word here in the houseOTHELLO
And go with you.OTHELLO
                  Ancient what makes he here?CASSIO
'Faith he to-night hath boarded a land carack:IAGO
If it prove lawful prize he's made for ever.IAGO
I do not understand.CASSIO
He's married.IAGO
To who?CASSIO
Marry to--Come captain will you go?IAGO
Have with you.OTHELLO
Here comes another troop to seek for you.CASSIO
It is Brabantio. General be advised;IAGO
He comes to bad intent.IAGO
Holla! stand there!OTHELLO
Signior it is the Moor.RODERIGO
Down with him thief!BRABANTIO
You Roderigo! come sir I am for you.IAGO
Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them.OTHELLO
Good signior you shall more command with yearsOTHELLO
Than with your weapons.OTHELLO
O thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter?BRABANTIO
Damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her;BRABANTIO
For I'll refer me to all things of senseBRABANTIO
If she in chains of magic were not boundBRABANTIO
Whether a maid so tender fair and happyBRABANTIO
So opposite to marriage that she shunnedBRABANTIO
The wealthy curled darlings of our nationBRABANTIO
Would ever have to incur a general mockBRABANTIO
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosomBRABANTIO
Of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight.BRABANTIO
Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in senseBRABANTIO
That thou hast practised on her with foul charmsBRABANTIO
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsBRABANTIO
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;BRABANTIO
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.BRABANTIO
I therefore apprehend and do attach theeBRABANTIO
For an abuser of the world a practiserBRABANTIO
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.BRABANTIO
Lay hold upon him: if he do resistBRABANTIO
Subdue him at his peril.BRABANTIO
Hold your handsOTHELLO
Both you of my inclining and the rest:OTHELLO
Were it my cue to fight I should have known itOTHELLO
Without a prompter. Where will you that I goOTHELLO
To answer this your charge?OTHELLO
To prison till fit timeBRABANTIO
Of law and course of direct sessionBRABANTIO
Call thee to answer.BRABANTIO
What if I do obey?OTHELLO
How may the duke be therewith satisfiedOTHELLO
Whose messengers are here about my sideOTHELLO
Upon some present business of the stateOTHELLO
To bring me to him?OTHELLO
'Tis true most worthy signior;First Officer
The duke's in council and your noble selfFirst Officer
I am sure is sent for.First Officer
How! the duke in council!BRABANTIO
In this time of the night! Bring him away:BRABANTIO
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himselfBRABANTIO
Or any of my brothers of the stateBRABANTIO
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;BRABANTIO
For if such actions may have passage freeBRABANTIO
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.BRABANTIO
There is no composition in these newsDUKE OF VENICE
That gives them credit.DUKE OF VENICE
Indeed they are disproportion'd;First Senator
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.First Senator
And mine a hundred and forty.DUKE OF VENICE
And mine two hundred:Second Senator
But though they jump not on a just account--Second Senator
As in these cases where the aim reportsSecond Senator
'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirmSecond Senator
A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus.Second Senator
Nay it is possible enough to judgment:DUKE OF VENICE
I do not so secure me in the errorDUKE OF VENICE
But the main article I do approveDUKE OF VENICE
In fearful sense.DUKE OF VENICE
[Within]  What ho! what ho! what ho!Sailor
A messenger from the galleys.First Officer
Now what's the business?DUKE OF VENICE
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;Sailor
So was I bid report here to the stateSailor
By Signior Angelo.Sailor
How say you by this change?DUKE OF VENICE
This cannot beFirst Senator
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageantFirst Senator
To keep us in false gaze. When we considerFirst Senator
The importancy of Cyprus to the TurkFirst Senator
And let ourselves again but understandFirst Senator
That as it more concerns the Turk than RhodesFirst Senator
So may he with more facile question bear itFirst Senator
For that it stands not in such warlike braceFirst Senator
But altogether lacks the abilitiesFirst Senator
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of thisFirst Senator
We must not think the Turk is so unskilfulFirst Senator
To leave that latest which concerns him firstFirst Senator
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gainFirst Senator
To wake and wage a danger profitless.First Senator
Nay in all confidence he's not for Rhodes.DUKE OF VENICE
Here is more news.First Officer
The Ottomites reverend and graciousMessenger
Steering with due course towards the isle of RhodesMessenger
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.Messenger
Ay so I thought. How many as you guess?First Senator
Of thirty sail: and now they do restemMessenger
Their backward course bearing with frank appearanceMessenger
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior MontanoMessenger
Your trusty and most valiant servitorMessenger
With his free duty recommends you thusMessenger
And prays you to believe him.Messenger
'Tis certain then for Cyprus.DUKE OF VENICE
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town?DUKE OF VENICE
He's now in Florence.First Senator
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.DUKE OF VENICE
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.First Senator
Valiant Othello we must straight employ youDUKE OF VENICE
Against the general enemy Ottoman.DUKE OF VENICE
I did not see you; welcome gentle signior;DUKE OF VENICE
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.DUKE OF VENICE
So did I yours. Good your grace pardon me;BRABANTIO
Neither my place nor aught I heard of businessBRABANTIO
Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general careBRABANTIO
Take hold on me for my particular griefBRABANTIO
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing natureBRABANTIO
That it engluts and swallows other sorrowsBRABANTIO
And it is still itself.BRABANTIO
Why what's the matter?DUKE OF VENICE
My daughter! O my daughter!BRABANTIO
Dead?Senator
Ay to me;BRABANTIO
She is abused stol'n from me and corruptedBRABANTIO
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;BRABANTIO
For nature so preposterously to errBRABANTIO
Being not deficient blind or lame of senseBRABANTIO
Sans witchcraft could not.BRABANTIO
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceedingDUKE OF VENICE
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herselfDUKE OF VENICE
And you of her the bloody book of lawDUKE OF VENICE
You shall yourself read in the bitter letterDUKE OF VENICE
After your own sense yea though our proper sonDUKE OF VENICE
Stood in your action.DUKE OF VENICE
Humbly I thank your grace.BRABANTIO
Here is the man this Moor whom now it seemsBRABANTIO
Your special mandate for the state-affairsBRABANTIO
Hath hither brought.BRABANTIO
We are very sorry for't.Senator
[To OTHELLO]  What in your own part can you say to this?DUKE OF VENICE
Nothing but this is so.BRABANTIO
Most potent grave and reverend signiorsOTHELLO
My very noble and approved good mastersOTHELLO
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughterOTHELLO
It is most true; true I have married her:OTHELLO
The very head and front of my offendingOTHELLO
Hath this extent no more. Rude am I in my speechOTHELLO
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:OTHELLO
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pithOTHELLO
Till now some nine moons wasted they have usedOTHELLO
Their dearest action in the tented fieldOTHELLO
And little of this great world can I speakOTHELLO
More than pertains to feats of broil and battleOTHELLO
And therefore little shall I grace my causeOTHELLO
In speaking for myself. Yet by your gracious patienceOTHELLO
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliverOTHELLO
Of my whole course of love; what drugs what charmsOTHELLO
What conjuration and what mighty magicOTHELLO
For such proceeding I am charged withalOTHELLO
I won his daughter.OTHELLO
A maiden never bold;BRABANTIO
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motionBRABANTIO
Blush'd at herself; and she in spite of natureBRABANTIO
Of years of country credit every thingBRABANTIO
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!BRABANTIO
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfectBRABANTIO
That will confess perfection so could errBRABANTIO
Against all rules of nature and must be drivenBRABANTIO
To find out practises of cunning hellBRABANTIO
Why this should be. I therefore vouch againBRABANTIO
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the bloodBRABANTIO
Or with some dram conjured to this effectBRABANTIO
He wrought upon her.BRABANTIO
To vouch this is no proofDUKE OF VENICE
Without more wider and more overt testDUKE OF VENICE
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoodsDUKE OF VENICE
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.DUKE OF VENICE
But Othello speak:First Senator
Did you by indirect and forced coursesFirst Senator
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?First Senator
Or came it by request and such fair questionFirst Senator
As soul to soul affordeth?First Senator
I do beseech youOTHELLO
Send for the lady to the SagittaryOTHELLO
And let her speak of me before her father:OTHELLO
If you do find me foul in her reportOTHELLO
The trust the office I do hold of youOTHELLO
Not only take away but let your sentenceOTHELLO
Even fall upon my life.OTHELLO
Fetch Desdemona hither.DUKE OF VENICE
Ancient conduct them: you best know the place.OTHELLO
And till she come as truly as to heavenOTHELLO
I do confess the vices of my bloodOTHELLO
So justly to your grave ears I'll presentOTHELLO
How I did thrive in this fair lady's loveOTHELLO
And she in mine.OTHELLO
Say it Othello.DUKE OF VENICE
Her father loved me; oft invited me;OTHELLO
Still question'd me the story of my lifeOTHELLO
From year to year the battles sieges fortunesOTHELLO
That I have passed.OTHELLO
I ran it through even from my boyish daysOTHELLO
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;OTHELLO
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chancesOTHELLO
Of moving accidents by flood and fieldOTHELLO
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breachOTHELLO
Of being taken by the insolent foeOTHELLO
And sold to slavery of my redemption thenceOTHELLO
And portance in my travels' history:OTHELLO
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idleOTHELLO
Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heavenOTHELLO
It was my hint to speak--such was the process;OTHELLO
And of the Cannibals that each other eatOTHELLO
The Anthropophagi and men whose headsOTHELLO
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hearOTHELLO
Would Desdemona seriously incline:OTHELLO
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:OTHELLO
Which ever as she could with haste dispatchOTHELLO
She'ld come again and with a greedy earOTHELLO
Devour up my discourse: which I observingOTHELLO
Took once a pliant hour and found good meansOTHELLO
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heartOTHELLO
That I would all my pilgrimage dilateOTHELLO
Whereof by parcels she had something heardOTHELLO
But not intentively: I did consentOTHELLO
And often did beguile her of her tearsOTHELLO
When I did speak of some distressful strokeOTHELLO
That my youth suffer'd. My story being doneOTHELLO
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:OTHELLO
She swore in faith twas strange 'twas passing strangeOTHELLO
'Twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful:OTHELLO
She wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'dOTHELLO
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd meOTHELLO
And bade me if I had a friend that loved herOTHELLO
I should but teach him how to tell my story.OTHELLO
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:OTHELLO
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'dOTHELLO
And I loved her that she did pity them.OTHELLO
This only is the witchcraft I have used:OTHELLO
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.OTHELLO
I think this tale would win my daughter too.DUKE OF VENICE
Good BrabantioDUKE OF VENICE
Take up this mangled matter at the best:DUKE OF VENICE
Men do their broken weapons rather useDUKE OF VENICE
Than their bare hands.DUKE OF VENICE
I pray you hear her speak:BRABANTIO
If she confess that she was half the wooerBRABANTIO
Destruction on my head if my bad blameBRABANTIO
Light on the man! Come hither gentle mistress:BRABANTIO
Do you perceive in all this noble companyBRABANTIO
Where most you owe obedience?BRABANTIO
My noble fatherDESDEMONA
I do perceive here a divided duty:DESDEMONA
To you I am bound for life and education;DESDEMONA
My life and education both do learn meDESDEMONA
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;DESDEMONA
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husbandDESDEMONA
And so much duty as my mother show'dDESDEMONA
To you preferring you before her fatherDESDEMONA
So much I challenge that I may professDESDEMONA
Due to the Moor my lord.DESDEMONA
God be wi' you! I have done.BRABANTIO
Please it your grace on to the state-affairs:BRABANTIO
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.BRABANTIO
Come hither Moor:BRABANTIO
I here do give thee that with all my heartBRABANTIO
Which but thou hast already with all my heartBRABANTIO
I would keep from thee. For your sake jewelBRABANTIO
I am glad at soul I have no other child:BRABANTIO
For thy escape would teach me tyrannyBRABANTIO
To hang clogs on them. I have done my lord.BRABANTIO
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentenceDUKE OF VENICE
Which as a grise or step may help these loversDUKE OF VENICE
Into your favour.DUKE OF VENICE
When remedies are past the griefs are endedDUKE OF VENICE
By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended.DUKE OF VENICE
To mourn a mischief that is past and goneDUKE OF VENICE
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.DUKE OF VENICE
What cannot be preserved when fortune takesDUKE OF VENICE
Patience her injury a mockery makes.DUKE OF VENICE
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;DUKE OF VENICE
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.DUKE OF VENICE
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;BRABANTIO
We lose it not so long as we can smile.BRABANTIO
He bears the sentence well that nothing bearsBRABANTIO
But the free comfort which from thence he hearsBRABANTIO
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrowBRABANTIO
That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow.BRABANTIO
These sentences to sugar or to gallBRABANTIO
Being strong on both sides are equivocal:BRABANTIO
But words are words; I never yet did hearBRABANTIO
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.BRABANTIO
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state.BRABANTIO
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes forDUKE OF VENICE
Cyprus. Othello the fortitude of the place is bestDUKE OF VENICE
known to you; and though we have there a substituteDUKE OF VENICE
of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion aDUKE OF VENICE
sovereign mistress of effects throws a more saferDUKE OF VENICE
voice on you: you must therefore be content toDUKE OF VENICE
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with thisDUKE OF VENICE
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.DUKE OF VENICE
The tyrant custom most grave senatorsOTHELLO
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of warOTHELLO
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agniseOTHELLO
A natural and prompt alacrityOTHELLO
I find in hardness and do undertakeOTHELLO
These present wars against the Ottomites.OTHELLO
Most humbly therefore bending to your stateOTHELLO
I crave fit disposition for my wife.OTHELLO
Due reference of place and exhibitionOTHELLO
With such accommodation and besortOTHELLO
As levels with her breeding.OTHELLO
If you pleaseDUKE OF VENICE
Be't at her father's.DUKE OF VENICE
I'll not have it so.BRABANTIO
Nor I.OTHELLO
     Nor I; I would not there resideDESDEMONA
To put my father in impatient thoughtsDESDEMONA
By being in his eye. Most gracious dukeDESDEMONA
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;DESDEMONA
And let me find a charter in your voiceDESDEMONA
To assist my simpleness.DESDEMONA
What would You Desdemona?DUKE OF VENICE
That I did love the Moor to live with himDESDEMONA
My downright violence and storm of fortunesDESDEMONA
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subduedDESDEMONA
Even to the very quality of my lord:DESDEMONA
I saw Othello's visage in his mindDESDEMONA
And to his honour and his valiant partsDESDEMONA
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.DESDEMONA
So that dear lords if I be left behindDESDEMONA
A moth of peace and he go to the warDESDEMONA
The rites for which I love him are bereft meDESDEMONA
And I a heavy interim shall supportDESDEMONA
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.DESDEMONA
Let her have your voices.OTHELLO
Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it notOTHELLO
To please the palate of my appetiteOTHELLO
Nor to comply with heat--the young affectsOTHELLO
In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.OTHELLO
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:OTHELLO
And heaven defend your good souls that you thinkOTHELLO
I will your serious and great business scantOTHELLO
For she is with me: no when light-wing'd toysOTHELLO
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullnessOTHELLO
My speculative and officed instrumentsOTHELLO
That my disports corrupt and taint my businessOTHELLO
Let housewives make a skillet of my helmOTHELLO
And all indign and base adversitiesOTHELLO
Make head against my estimation!OTHELLO
Be it as you shall privately determineDUKE OF VENICE
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries hasteDUKE OF VENICE
And speed must answer it.DUKE OF VENICE
You must away to-night.First Senator
With all my heart.OTHELLO
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.DUKE OF VENICE
Othello leave some officer behindDUKE OF VENICE
And he shall our commission bring to you;DUKE OF VENICE
With such things else of quality and respectDUKE OF VENICE
As doth import you.DUKE OF VENICE
So please your grace my ancient;OTHELLO
A man he is of honest and trust:OTHELLO
To his conveyance I assign my wifeOTHELLO
With what else needful your good grace shall thinkOTHELLO
To be sent after me.OTHELLO
Let it be so.DUKE OF VENICE
Good night to every one.DUKE OF VENICE
And noble signiorDUKE OF VENICE
If virtue no delighted beauty lackDUKE OF VENICE
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.DUKE OF VENICE
Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well.First Senator
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see:BRABANTIO
She has deceived her father and may thee.BRABANTIO
My life upon her faith! Honest IagoOTHELLO
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:OTHELLO
I prithee let thy wife attend on her:OTHELLO
And bring them after in the best advantage.OTHELLO
Come Desdemona: I have but an hourOTHELLO
Of love of worldly matters and directionOTHELLO
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.OTHELLO
Iago--RODERIGO
What say'st thou noble heart?IAGO
What will I do thinkest thou?RODERIGO
Why go to bed and sleep.IAGO
I will incontinently drown myself.RODERIGO
If thou dost I shall never love thee after. WhyIAGO
thou silly gentleman!IAGO
It is silliness to live when to live is torment; andRODERIGO
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.RODERIGO
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for fourIAGO
times seven years; and since I could distinguishIAGO
betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found manIAGO
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say IIAGO
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen IIAGO
would change my humanity with a baboon.IAGO
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be soRODERIGO
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.RODERIGO
Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thusIAGO
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens to the whichIAGO
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plantIAGO
nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed upIAGO
thyme supply it with one gender of herbs orIAGO
distract it with many either to have it sterileIAGO
with idleness or manured with industry why theIAGO
power and corrigible authority of this lies in ourIAGO
wills. If the balance of our lives had not oneIAGO
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality theIAGO
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct usIAGO
to most preposterous conclusions: but we haveIAGO
reason to cool our raging motions our carnalIAGO
stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this thatIAGO
you call love to be a sect or scion.IAGO
It cannot be.RODERIGO
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission ofIAGO
the will. Come be a man. Drown thyself! drownIAGO
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thyIAGO
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving withIAGO
cables of perdurable toughness; I could neverIAGO
better stead thee than now. Put money in thyIAGO
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour withIAGO
an usurped beard; I say put money in thy purse. ItIAGO
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue herIAGO
love to the Moor-- put money in thy purse--nor heIAGO
his to her: it was a violent commencement and thouIAGO
shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put butIAGO
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable inIAGO
their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the foodIAGO
that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall beIAGO
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She mustIAGO
change for youth: when she is sated with his bodyIAGO
she will find the error of her choice: she mustIAGO
have change she must: therefore put money in thyIAGO
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it aIAGO
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the moneyIAGO
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixtIAGO
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian notIAGO
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thouIAGO
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox ofIAGO
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seekIAGO
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy thanIAGO
to be drowned and go without her.IAGO
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend onRODERIGO
the issue?RODERIGO
Thou art sure of me:--go make money:--I have toldIAGO
thee often and I re-tell thee again and again IIAGO
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath noIAGO
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revengeIAGO
against him: if thou canst cuckold him thou dostIAGO
thyself a pleasure me a sport. There are manyIAGO
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.IAGO
Traverse! go provide thy money. We will have moreIAGO
of this to-morrow. Adieu.IAGO
Where shall we meet i' the morning?RODERIGO
At my lodging.IAGO
I'll be with thee betimes.RODERIGO
Go to; farewell. Do you hear Roderigo?IAGO
What say you?RODERIGO
No more of drowning do you hear?IAGO
I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.RODERIGO
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:IAGO
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profaneIAGO
If I would time expend with such a snipe.IAGO
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:IAGO
And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheetsIAGO
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;IAGO
But I for mere suspicion in that kindIAGO
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;IAGO
The better shall my purpose work on him.IAGO
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:IAGO
To get his place and to plume up my willIAGO
In double knavery--How how? Let's see:--IAGO
After some time to abuse Othello's earIAGO
That he is too familiar with his wife.IAGO
He hath a person and a smooth disposeIAGO
To be suspected framed to make women false.IAGO
The Moor is of a free and open natureIAGO
That thinks men honest that but seem to be soIAGO
And will as tenderly be led by the noseIAGO
As asses are.IAGO
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and nightIAGO
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.IAGO
What from the cape can you discern at sea?MONTANO
Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;First Gentleman
I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the mainFirst Gentleman
Descry a sail.First Gentleman
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;MONTANO
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:MONTANO
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the seaMONTANO
What ribs of oak when mountains melt on themMONTANO
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?MONTANO
A segregation of the Turkish fleet:Second Gentleman
For do but stand upon the foaming shoreSecond Gentleman
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;Second Gentleman
The wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous maneSecond Gentleman
seems to cast water on the burning bearSecond Gentleman
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:Second Gentleman
I never did like molestation viewSecond Gentleman
On the enchafed flood.Second Gentleman
If that the Turkish fleetMONTANO
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd:MONTANO
It is impossible they bear it out.MONTANO
News lads! our wars are done.Third Gentleman
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the TurksThird Gentleman
That their designment halts: a noble ship of VeniceThird Gentleman
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferanceThird Gentleman
On most part of their fleet.Third Gentleman
How! is this true?MONTANO
The ship is here put inThird Gentleman
A Veronesa; Michael CassioThird Gentleman
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor OthelloThird Gentleman
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at seaThird Gentleman
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.Third Gentleman
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.MONTANO
But this same Cassio though he speak of comfortThird Gentleman
Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadlyThird Gentleman
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were partedThird Gentleman
With foul and violent tempest.Third Gentleman
Pray heavens he be;MONTANO
For I have served him and the man commandsMONTANO
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside ho!MONTANO
As well to see the vessel that's come inMONTANO
As to throw out our eyes for brave OthelloMONTANO
Even till we make the main and the aerial blueMONTANO
An indistinct regard.MONTANO
Come let's do so:Third Gentleman
For every minute is expectancyThird Gentleman
Of more arrivance.Third Gentleman
Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isleCASSIO
That so approve the Moor! O let the heavensCASSIO
Give him defence against the elementsCASSIO
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.CASSIO
Is he well shipp'd?MONTANO
His bark is stoutly timber'd his pilotCASSIO
Of very expert and approved allowance;CASSIO
Therefore my hopes not surfeited to deathCASSIO
Stand in bold cure.CASSIO
What noise?CASSIO
The town is empty; on the brow o' the seaFourth Gentleman
Stand ranks of people and they cry 'A sail!'Fourth Gentleman
My hopes do shape him for the governor.CASSIO
They do discharge their shot of courtesy:Second Gentlemen
Our friends at least.Second Gentlemen
I pray you sir go forthCASSIO
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.CASSIO
I shall.Second Gentleman
But good lieutenant is your general wived?MONTANO
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maidCASSIO
That paragons description and wild fame;CASSIO
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pensCASSIO
And in the essential vesture of creationCASSIO
Does tire the ingener.CASSIO
How now! who has put in?CASSIO
'Tis one Iago ancient to the general.Second Gentleman
Has had most favourable and happy speed:CASSIO
Tempests themselves high seas and howling windsCASSIO
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--CASSIO
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel--CASSIO
As having sense of beauty do omitCASSIO
Their mortal natures letting go safely byCASSIO
The divine Desdemona.CASSIO
What is she?MONTANO
She that I spake of our great captain's captainCASSIO
Left in the conduct of the bold IagoCASSIO
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughtsCASSIO
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove Othello guardCASSIO
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breathCASSIO
That he may bless this bay with his tall shipCASSIO
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's armsCASSIO
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spiritsCASSIO
And bring all Cyprus comfort!CASSIO
O beholdCASSIO
The riches of the ship is come on shore!CASSIO
Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees.CASSIO
Hail to thee lady! and the grace of heavenCASSIO
Before behind thee and on every handCASSIO
Enwheel thee round!CASSIO
I thank you valiant Cassio.DESDEMONA
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?DESDEMONA
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aughtCASSIO
But that he's well and will be shortly here.CASSIO
O but I fear--How lost you company?DESDEMONA
The great contention of the sea and skiesCASSIO
Parted our fellowship--But hark! a sail.CASSIO
They give their greeting to the citadel;Second Gentleman
This likewise is a friend.Second Gentleman
See for the news.CASSIO
Good ancient you are welcome.CASSIO
Welcome mistress.CASSIO
Let it not gall your patience good IagoCASSIO
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breedingCASSIO
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.CASSIO
Sir would she give you so much of her lipsIAGO
As of her tongue she oft bestows on meIAGO
You'll have enough.IAGO
Alas she has no speech.DESDEMONA
In faith too much;IAGO
I find it still when I have list to sleep:IAGO
Marry before your ladyship I grantIAGO
She puts her tongue a little in her heartIAGO
And chides with thinking.IAGO
You have little cause to say so.EMILIA
Come on come on; you are pictures out of doorsIAGO
Bells in your parlors wild-cats in your kitchensIAGO
Saints m your injuries devils being offendedIAGO
Players in your housewifery and housewives' in your beds.IAGO
O fie upon thee slanderer!DESDEMONA
Nay it is true or else I am a Turk:IAGO
You rise to play and go to bed to work.IAGO
You shall not write my praise.EMILIA
No let me not.IAGO
What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldstDESDEMONA
praise me?DESDEMONA
O gentle lady do not put me to't;IAGO
For I am nothing if not critical.IAGO
Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?DESDEMONA
Ay madam.IAGO
I am not merry; but I do beguileDESDEMONA
The thing I am by seeming otherwise.DESDEMONA
Come how wouldst thou praise me?DESDEMONA
I am about it; but indeed my inventionIAGO
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;IAGO
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse laboursIAGO
And thus she is deliver'd.IAGO
If she be fair and wise fairness and witIAGO
The one's for use the other useth it.IAGO
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?DESDEMONA
If she be black and thereto have a witIAGO
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.IAGO
Worse and worse.DESDEMONA
How if fair and foolish?EMILIA
She never yet was foolish that was fair;IAGO
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.IAGO
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'DESDEMONA
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou forDESDEMONA
her that's foul and foolish?DESDEMONA
There's none so foul and foolish thereuntoIAGO
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.IAGO
O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.DESDEMONA
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deservingDESDEMONA
woman indeed one that in the authority of herDESDEMONA
merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?DESDEMONA
She that was ever fair and never proudIAGO
Had tongue at will and yet was never loudIAGO
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gayIAGO
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may'IAGO
She that being anger'd her revenge being nighIAGO
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure flyIAGO
She that in wisdom never was so frailIAGO
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;IAGO
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mindIAGO
See suitors following and not look behindIAGO
She was a wight if ever such wight were--IAGO
To do what?DESDEMONA
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.IAGO
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learnDESDEMONA
of him Emilia though he be thy husband. How sayDESDEMONA
you Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberalDESDEMONA
counsellor?DESDEMONA
He speaks home madam: You may relish him more inCASSIO
the soldier than in the scholar.CASSIO
[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay well saidIAGO
whisper: with as little a web as this will IIAGO
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay smile uponIAGO
her do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.IAGO
You say true; 'tis so indeed: if such tricks asIAGO
these strip you out of your lieutenantry it hadIAGO
been better you had not kissed your three fingers soIAGO
oft which now again you are most apt to play theIAGO
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellentIAGO
courtesy! 'tis so indeed. Yet again your fingersIAGO
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!IAGO
The Moor! I know his trumpet.IAGO
'Tis truly so.CASSIO
Let's meet him and receive him.DESDEMONA
Lo where he comes!CASSIO
O my fair warrior!OTHELLO
                  My dear Othello!DESDEMONA
It gives me wonder great as my contentOTHELLO
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!OTHELLO
If after every tempest come such calmsOTHELLO
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!OTHELLO
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seasOTHELLO
Olympus-high and duck again as lowOTHELLO
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to dieOTHELLO
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fearOTHELLO
My soul hath her content so absoluteOTHELLO
That not another comfort like to thisOTHELLO
Succeeds in unknown fate.OTHELLO
The heavens forbidDESDEMONA
But that our loves and comforts should increaseDESDEMONA
Even as our days do grow!DESDEMONA
Amen to that sweet powers!OTHELLO
I cannot speak enough of this content;OTHELLO
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:OTHELLO
And this and this the greatest discords beOTHELLO
That e'er our hearts shall make!OTHELLO
[Aside]  O you are well tuned now!IAGO
But I'll set down the pegs that make this musicIAGO
As honest as I am.IAGO
                  Come let us to the castle.OTHELLO
News friends; our wars are done the TurksOTHELLO
are drown'd.OTHELLO
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?OTHELLO
Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus;OTHELLO
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweetOTHELLO
I prattle out of fashion and I doteOTHELLO
In mine own comforts. I prithee good IagoOTHELLO
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:OTHELLO
Bring thou the master to the citadel;OTHELLO
He is a good one and his worthinessOTHELLO
Does challenge much respect. Come DesdemonaOTHELLO
Once more well met at Cyprus.OTHELLO
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. ComeIAGO
hither. If thou be'st valiant-- as they say baseIAGO
men being in love have then a nobility in theirIAGO
natures more than is native to them--list me. TheIAGO
lieutenant tonight watches on the court ofIAGO
guard:--first I must tell thee this--Desdemona isIAGO
directly in love with him.IAGO
With him! why 'tis not possible.RODERIGO
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed.IAGO
Mark me with what violence she first loved the MoorIAGO
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:IAGO
and will she love him still for prating? let notIAGO
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;IAGO
and what delight shall she have to look on theIAGO
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act ofIAGO
sport there should be again to inflame it and toIAGO
give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favourIAGO
sympathy in years manners and beauties; all whichIAGO
the Moor is defective in: now for want of theseIAGO
required conveniences her delicate tenderness willIAGO
find itself abused begin to heave the gorgeIAGO
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature willIAGO
instruct her in it and compel her to some secondIAGO
choice. Now sir this granted--as it is a mostIAGO
pregnant and unforced position--who stands soIAGO
eminent in the degree of this fortune as CassioIAGO
does? a knave very voluble; no furtherIAGO
conscionable than in putting on the mere form ofIAGO
civil and humane seeming for the better compassingIAGO
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? whyIAGO
none; why none: a slipper and subtle knave aIAGO
finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp andIAGO
counterfeit advantages though true advantage neverIAGO
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides theIAGO
knave is handsome young and hath all thoseIAGO
requisites in him that folly and green minds lookIAGO
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the womanIAGO
hath found him already.IAGO
I cannot believe that in her; she's full ofRODERIGO
most blessed condition.RODERIGO
Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made ofIAGO
grapes: if she had been blessed she would neverIAGO
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thouIAGO
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didstIAGO
not mark that?IAGO
Yes that I did; but that was but courtesy.RODERIGO
Lechery by this hand; an index and obscure prologueIAGO
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They metIAGO
so near with their lips that their breaths embracedIAGO
together. Villanous thoughts Roderigo! when theseIAGO
mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comesIAGO
the master and main exercise the incorporateIAGO
conclusion Pish! But sir be you ruled by me: IIAGO
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;IAGO
for the command I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knowsIAGO
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you findIAGO
some occasion to anger Cassio either by speakingIAGO
too loud or tainting his discipline; or from whatIAGO
other course you please which the time shall moreIAGO
favourably minister.IAGO
Well.RODERIGO
Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haplyIAGO
may strike at you: provoke him that he may; forIAGO
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus toIAGO
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no trueIAGO
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. SoIAGO
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires byIAGO
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and theIAGO
impediment most profitably removed without theIAGO
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.IAGO
I will do this if I can bring it to anyRODERIGO
opportunity.RODERIGO
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:IAGO
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.IAGO
Adieu.RODERIGO
That Cassio loves her I do well believe it;IAGO
That she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit:IAGO
The Moor howbeit that I endure him notIAGO
Is of a constant loving noble natureIAGO
And I dare think he'll prove to DesdemonaIAGO
A most dear husband. Now I do love her too;IAGO
Not out of absolute lust though peradventureIAGO
I stand accountant for as great a sinIAGO
But partly led to diet my revengeIAGO
For that I do suspect the lusty MoorIAGO
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereofIAGO
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards;IAGO
And nothing can or shall content my soulIAGO
Till I am even'd with him wife for wifeIAGO
Or failing so yet that I put the MoorIAGO
At least into a jealousy so strongIAGO
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to doIAGO
If this poor trash of Venice whom I trashIAGO
For his quick hunting stand the putting onIAGO
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hipIAGO
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--IAGO
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--IAGO
Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me.IAGO
For making him egregiously an assIAGO
And practising upon his peace and quietIAGO
Even to madness. 'Tis here but yet confused:IAGO
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.IAGO
It is Othello's pleasure our noble and valiantHerald
general that upon certain tidings now arrivedHerald
importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleetHerald
every man put himself into triumph; some to danceHerald
some to make bonfires each man to what sport andHerald
revels his addiction leads him: for besides theseHerald
beneficial news it is the celebration of hisHerald
nuptial. So much was his pleasure should beHerald
proclaimed. All offices are open and there is fullHerald
liberty of feasting from this present hour of fiveHerald
till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless theHerald
isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!Herald
Good Michael look you to the guard to-night:OTHELLO
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stopOTHELLO
Not to outsport discretion.OTHELLO
Iago hath direction what to do;CASSIO
But notwithstanding with my personal eyeCASSIO
Will I look to't.CASSIO
                  Iago is most honest.OTHELLO
Michael good night: to-morrow with your earliestOTHELLO
Let me have speech with you.OTHELLO
Come my dear loveOTHELLO
The purchase made the fruits are to ensue;OTHELLO
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.OTHELLO
Good night.OTHELLO
Welcome Iago; we must to the watch.CASSIO
Not this hour lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' theIAGO
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the loveIAGO
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:IAGO
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; andIAGO
she is sport for Jove.IAGO
She's a most exquisite lady.CASSIO
And I'll warrant her fun of game.IAGO
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.CASSIO
What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley ofIAGO
provocation.IAGO
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.CASSIO
And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love?IAGO
She is indeed perfection.CASSIO
Well happiness to their sheets! Come lieutenant IIAGO
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a braceIAGO
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure toIAGO
the health of black Othello.IAGO
Not to-night good Iago: I have very poor andCASSIO
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wishCASSIO
courtesy would invent some other custom ofCASSIO
entertainment.CASSIO
O they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink forIAGO
you.IAGO
I have drunk but one cup to-night and that wasCASSIO
craftily qualified too and behold what innovationCASSIO
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmityCASSIO
and dare not task my weakness with any more.CASSIO
What man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallantsIAGO
desire it.IAGO
Where are they?CASSIO
Here at the door; I pray you call them in.IAGO
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.CASSIO
If I can fasten but one cup upon himIAGO
With that which he hath drunk to-night alreadyIAGO
He'll be as full of quarrel and offenceIAGO
As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool RoderigoIAGO
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side outIAGO
To Desdemona hath to-night carousedIAGO
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:IAGO
Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spiritsIAGO
That hold their honours in a wary distanceIAGO
The very elements of this warlike isleIAGO
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cupsIAGO
And they watch too. Now 'mongst this flock of drunkardsIAGO
Am I to put our Cassio in some actionIAGO
That may offend the isle.--But here they come:IAGO
If consequence do but approve my dreamIAGO
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.IAGO
'Fore God they have given me a rouse already.CASSIO
Good faith a little one; not past a pint as I amMONTANO
a soldier.MONTANO
Some wine ho!IAGO
And let me the canakin clink clink;IAGO
And let me the canakin clinkIAGO
A soldier's a man;IAGO
A life's but a span;IAGO
Why then let a soldier drink.IAGO
Some wine boys!IAGO
'Fore God an excellent song.CASSIO
I learned it in England where indeed they areIAGO
most potent in potting: your Dane your German andIAGO
your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink ho!--are nothingIAGO
to your English.IAGO
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?CASSIO
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane deadIAGO
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; heIAGO
gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottleIAGO
can be filled.IAGO
To the health of our general!CASSIO
I am for it lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.MONTANO
O sweet England!IAGO
King Stephen was a worthy peerIAGO
His breeches cost him but a crown;IAGO
He held them sixpence all too dearIAGO
With that he call'd the tailor lown.IAGO
He was a wight of high renownIAGO
And thou art but of low degree:IAGO
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;IAGO
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.IAGO
Some wine ho!IAGO
Why this is a more exquisite song than the other.CASSIO
Will you hear't again?IAGO
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place thatCASSIO
does those things. Well God's above all; and thereCASSIO
be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved.CASSIO
It's true good lieutenant.IAGO
For mine own part--no offence to the general norCASSIO
any man of quality--I hope to be saved.CASSIO
And so do I too lieutenant.IAGO
Ay but by your leave not before me; theCASSIO
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let'sCASSIO
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--ForgiveCASSIO
us our sins!--Gentlemen let's look to our business.CASSIO
Do not think gentlemen. I am drunk: this is myCASSIO
ancient; this is my right hand and this is my left:CASSIO
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough andCASSIO
speak well enough.CASSIO
Excellent well.All
Why very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.CASSIO
To the platform masters; come let's set the watch.MONTANO
You see this fellow that is gone before;IAGO
He is a soldier fit to stand by CaesarIAGO
And give direction: and do but see his vice;IAGO
'Tis to his virtue a just equinoxIAGO
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.IAGO
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.IAGO
On some odd time of his infirmityIAGO
Will shake this island.IAGO
But is he often thus?MONTANO
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:IAGO
He'll watch the horologe a double setIAGO
If drink rock not his cradle.IAGO
It were wellMONTANO
The general were put in mind of it.MONTANO
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good natureMONTANO
Prizes the virtue that appears in CassioMONTANO
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?MONTANO
[Aside to him]  How now Roderigo!IAGO
I pray you after the lieutenant; go.IAGO
And 'tis great pity that the noble MoorMONTANO
Should hazard such a place as his own secondMONTANO
With one of an ingraft infirmity:MONTANO
It were an honest action to sayMONTANO
So to the Moor.MONTANO
                  Not I for this fair island:IAGO
I do love Cassio well; and would do muchIAGO
To cure him of this evil--But hark! what noise?IAGO
You rogue! you rascal!CASSIO
What's the matter lieutenant?MONTANO
A knave teach me my duty!CASSIO
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.CASSIO
Beat me!RODERIGO
       Dost thou prate rogue?CASSIO
Nay good lieutenant;MONTANO
I pray you sir hold your hand.MONTANO
Let me go sirCASSIO
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.CASSIO
Come comeMONTANO
you're drunk.MONTANO
Drunk!CASSIO
[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away I say; go out and cry a mutiny.IAGO
Nay good lieutenant--alas gentlemen;--IAGO
Help ho!--Lieutenant--sir--Montano--sir;IAGO
Help masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!IAGO
Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo ho!IAGO
The town will rise: God's will lieutenant hold!IAGO
You will be shamed for ever.IAGO
What is the matter here?OTHELLO
'Zounds I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.MONTANO
Hold for your lives!OTHELLO
Hold ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--gentlemen--IAGO
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?IAGO
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold hold for shame!IAGO
Why how now ho! from whence ariseth this?OTHELLO
Are we turn'd Turks and to ourselves do thatOTHELLO
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?OTHELLO
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl:OTHELLO
He that stirs next to carve for his own rageOTHELLO
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.OTHELLO
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isleOTHELLO
From her propriety. What is the matter masters?OTHELLO
Honest Iago that look'st dead with grievingOTHELLO
Speak who began this? on thy love I charge thee.OTHELLO
I do not know: friends all but now even nowIAGO
In quarter and in terms like bride and groomIAGO
Devesting them for bed; and then but now--IAGO
As if some planet had unwitted men--IAGO
Swords out and tilting one at other's breastIAGO
In opposition bloody. I cannot speakIAGO
Any beginning to this peevish odds;IAGO
And would in action glorious I had lostIAGO
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!IAGO
How comes it Michael you are thus forgot?OTHELLO
I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.CASSIO
Worthy Montano you were wont be civil;OTHELLO
The gravity and stillness of your youthOTHELLO
The world hath noted and your name is greatOTHELLO
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matterOTHELLO
That you unlace your reputation thusOTHELLO
And spend your rich opinion for the nameOTHELLO
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.OTHELLO
Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger:MONTANO
Your officer Iago can inform you--MONTANO
While I spare speech which something nowMONTANO
offends me--MONTANO
Of all that I do know: nor know I aughtMONTANO
By me that's said or done amiss this night;MONTANO
Unless self-charity be sometimes a viceMONTANO
And to defend ourselves it be a sinMONTANO
When violence assails us.MONTANO
Now by heavenOTHELLO
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;OTHELLO
And passion having my best judgment colliedOTHELLO
Assays to lead the way: if I once stirOTHELLO
Or do but lift this arm the best of youOTHELLO
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to knowOTHELLO
How this foul rout began who set it on;OTHELLO
And he that is approved in this offenceOTHELLO
Though he had twinn'd with me both at a birthOTHELLO
Shall lose me. What! in a town of warOTHELLO
Yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fearOTHELLO
To manage private and domestic quarrelOTHELLO
In night and on the court and guard of safety!OTHELLO
'Tis monstrous. Iago who began't?OTHELLO
If partially affined or leagued in officeMONTANO
Thou dost deliver more or less than truthMONTANO
Thou art no soldier.MONTANO
Touch me not so near:IAGO
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouthIAGO
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;IAGO
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truthIAGO
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is general.IAGO
Montano and myself being in speechIAGO
There comes a fellow crying out for help:IAGO
And Cassio following him with determined swordIAGO
To execute upon him. Sir this gentlemanIAGO
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause:IAGO
Myself the crying fellow did pursueIAGO
Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--IAGO
The town might fall in fright: he swift of footIAGO
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the ratherIAGO
For that I heard the clink and fall of swordsIAGO
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-nightIAGO
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--IAGO
For this was brief--I found them close togetherIAGO
At blow and thrust; even as again they wereIAGO
When you yourself did part them.IAGO
More of this matter cannot I report:IAGO
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:IAGO
Though Cassio did some little wrong to himIAGO
As men in rage strike those that wish them bestIAGO
Yet surely Cassio I believe receivedIAGO
From him that fled some strange indignityIAGO
Which patience could not pass.IAGO
I know IagoOTHELLO
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matterOTHELLO
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio I love theeOTHELLO
But never more be officer of mine.OTHELLO
Look if my gentle love be not raised up!OTHELLO
I'll make thee an example.OTHELLO
What's the matter?DESDEMONA
All's well now sweeting; come away to bed.OTHELLO
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon:OTHELLO
Lead him off.OTHELLO
Iago look with care about the townOTHELLO
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.OTHELLO
Come Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' lifeOTHELLO
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.OTHELLO
What are you hurt lieutenant?IAGO
Ay past all surgery.CASSIO
Marry heaven forbid!IAGO
Reputation reputation reputation! O I have lostCASSIO
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part ofCASSIO
myself and what remains is bestial. My reputationCASSIO
Iago my reputation!CASSIO
As I am an honest man I thought you had receivedIAGO
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that thanIAGO
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most falseIAGO
imposition: oft got without merit and lost withoutIAGO
deserving: you have lost no reputation at allIAGO
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What man!IAGO
there are ways to recover the general again: youIAGO
are but now cast in his mood a punishment more inIAGO
policy than in malice even so as one would beat hisIAGO
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sueIAGO
to him again and he's yours.IAGO
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive soCASSIO
good a commander with so slight so drunken and soCASSIO
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?CASSIO
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourseCASSIO
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisibleCASSIO
spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known byCASSIO
let us call thee devil!CASSIO
What was he that you followed with your sword? WhatIAGO
had he done to you?IAGO
I know not.CASSIO
Is't possible?IAGO
I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly;CASSIO
a quarrel but nothing wherefore. O God that menCASSIO
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal awayCASSIO
their brains! that we should with joy pleasanceCASSIO
revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts!CASSIO
Why but you are now well enough: how came you thusIAGO
recovered?IAGO
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give placeCASSIO
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows meCASSIO
another to make me frankly despise myself.CASSIO
Come you are too severe a moraler: as the timeIAGO
the place and the condition of this countryIAGO
stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen;IAGO
but since it is as it is mend it for your own good.IAGO
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell meCASSIO
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as HydraCASSIO
such an answer would stop them all. To be now aCASSIO
sensible man by and by a fool and presently aCASSIO
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup isCASSIO
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.CASSIO
Come come good wine is a good familiar creatureIAGO
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.IAGO
And good lieutenant I think you think I love you.IAGO
I have well approved it sir. I drunk!CASSIO
You or any man living may be drunk! at a time man.IAGO
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wifeIAGO
is now the general: may say so in this respect forIAGO
that he hath devoted and given up himself to theIAGO
contemplation mark and denotement of her parts andIAGO
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importuneIAGO
her help to put you in your place again: she is ofIAGO
so free so kind so apt so blessed a dispositionIAGO
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do moreIAGO
than she is requested: this broken joint betweenIAGO
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and myIAGO
fortunes against any lay worth naming thisIAGO
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.IAGO
You advise me well.CASSIO
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.IAGO
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I willCASSIO
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:CASSIO
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.CASSIO
You are in the right. Good night lieutenant; IIAGO
must to the watch.IAGO
CASSIO: Good night honest Iago.IAGO
And what's he then that says I play the villain?IAGO
When this advice is free I give and honestIAGO
Probal to thinking and indeed the courseIAGO
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easyIAGO
The inclining Desdemona to subdueIAGO
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitfulIAGO
As the free elements. And then for herIAGO
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptismIAGO
All seals and symbols of redeemed sinIAGO
His soul is so enfetter'd to her loveIAGO
That she may make unmake do what she listIAGO
Even as her appetite shall play the godIAGO
With his weak function. How am I then a villainIAGO
To counsel Cassio to this parallel courseIAGO
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!IAGO
When devils will the blackest sins put onIAGO
They do suggest at first with heavenly showsIAGO
As I do now: for whiles this honest foolIAGO
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunesIAGO
And she for him pleads strongly to the MoorIAGO
I'll pour this pestilence into his earIAGO
That she repeals him for her body's lust;IAGO
And by how much she strives to do him goodIAGO
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.IAGO
So will I turn her virtue into pitchIAGO
And out of her own goodness make the netIAGO
That shall enmesh them all.IAGO
How now Roderigo!IAGO
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound thatRODERIGO
hunts but one that fills up the cry. My money isRODERIGO
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly wellRODERIGO
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be I shallRODERIGO
have so much experience for my pains and so withRODERIGO
no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice.RODERIGO
How poor are they that have not patience!IAGO
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?IAGO
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft;IAGO
And wit depends on dilatory time.IAGO
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.IAGO
And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio:IAGO
Though other things grow fair against the sunIAGO
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:IAGO
Content thyself awhile. By the mass 'tis morning;IAGO
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.IAGO
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:IAGO
Away I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:IAGO
Nay get thee gone.IAGO
Two things are to be done:IAGO
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;IAGO
I'll set her on;IAGO
Myself the while to draw the Moor apartIAGO
And bring him jump when he may Cassio findIAGO
Soliciting his wife: ay that's the wayIAGO
Dull not device by coldness and delay.IAGO
Masters play here; I will content your pains;CASSIO
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow general.'CASSIO
Why masters have your instruments been in NaplesClown
that they speak i' the nose thus?Clown
How sir how!First Musician
Are these I pray you wind-instruments?Clown
Ay marry are they sir.First Musician
O thereby hangs a tail.Clown
Whereby hangs a tale sir?First Musician
Marry. sir by many a wind-instrument that I know.Clown
But masters here's money for you: and the generalClown
so likes your music that he desires you for love'sClown
sake to make no more noise with it.Clown
Well sir we will not.First Musician
If you have any music that may not be heard to'tClown
again: but as they say to hear music the generalClown
does not greatly care.Clown
We have none such sir.First Musician
Then put up your pipes in your bag for I'll away:Clown
go; vanish into air; away!Clown
Dost thou hear my honest friend?CASSIO
No I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.Clown
Prithee keep up thy quillets. There's a poor pieceCASSIO
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attendsCASSIO
the general's wife be stirring tell her there'sCASSIO
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:CASSIO
wilt thou do this?CASSIO
She is stirring sir: if she will stir hither IClown
shall seem to notify unto her.Clown
Do good my friend.CASSIO
In happy time Iago.CASSIO
You have not been a-bed then?IAGO
Why no; the day had brokeCASSIO
Before we parted. I have made bold IagoCASSIO
To send in to your wife: my suit to herCASSIO
Is that she will to virtuous DesdemonaCASSIO
Procure me some access.CASSIO
I'll send her to you presently;IAGO
And I'll devise a mean to draw the MoorIAGO
Out of the way that your converse and businessIAGO
May be more free.IAGO
I humbly thank you for't.CASSIO
I never knewCASSIO
A Florentine more kind and honest.CASSIO
Good morrow good Lieutenant: I am sorryEMILIA
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.EMILIA
The general and his wife are talking of it;EMILIA
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor repliesEMILIA
That he you hurt is of great fame in CyprusEMILIA
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdomEMILIA
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves youEMILIA
And needs no other suitor but his likingsEMILIA
To take the safest occasion by the frontEMILIA
To bring you in again.EMILIA
Yet I beseech youCASSIO
If you think fit or that it may be doneCASSIO
Give me advantage of some brief discourseCASSIO
With Desdemona alone.CASSIO
Pray you come in;EMILIA
I will bestow you where you shall have timeEMILIA
To speak your bosom freely.EMILIA
I am much bound to you.CASSIO
These letters give Iago to the pilot;OTHELLO
And by him do my duties to the senate:OTHELLO
That done I will be walking on the works;OTHELLO
Repair there to me.OTHELLO
Well my good lord I'll do't.IAGO
This fortification gentlemen shall we see't?OTHELLO
We'll wait upon your lordship.Gentleman
Be thou assured good Cassio I will doDESDEMONA
All my abilities in thy behalf.DESDEMONA
Good madam do: I warrant it grieves my husbandEMILIA
As if the case were his.EMILIA
O that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt CassioDESDEMONA
But I will have my lord and you againDESDEMONA
As friendly as you were.DESDEMONA
Bounteous madamCASSIO
Whatever shall become of Michael CassioCASSIO
He's never any thing but your true servant.CASSIO
I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:DESDEMONA
You have known him long; and be you well assuredDESDEMONA
He shall in strangeness stand no further offDESDEMONA
Than in a polite distance.DESDEMONA
Ay but ladyCASSIO
That policy may either last so longCASSIO
Or feed upon such nice and waterish dietCASSIO
Or breed itself so out of circumstanceCASSIO
That I being absent and my place suppliedCASSIO
My general will forget my love and service.CASSIO
Do not doubt that; before Emilia hereDESDEMONA
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure theeDESDEMONA
If I do vow a friendship I'll perform itDESDEMONA
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;DESDEMONA
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;DESDEMONA
His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift;DESDEMONA
I'll intermingle every thing he doesDESDEMONA
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry Cassio;DESDEMONA
For thy solicitor shall rather dieDESDEMONA
Than give thy cause away.DESDEMONA
Madam here comes my lord.EMILIA
Madam I'll take my leave.CASSIO
Why stay and hear me speak.DESDEMONA
Madam not now: I am very ill at easeCASSIO
Unfit for mine own purposes.CASSIO
Well do your discretion.DESDEMONA
Ha! I like not that.IAGO
What dost thou say?OTHELLO
Nothing my lord: or if--I know not what.IAGO
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?OTHELLO
Cassio my lord! No sure I cannot think itIAGO
That he would steal away so guilty-likeIAGO
Seeing you coming.IAGO
                  I do believe 'twas he.OTHELLO
How now my lord!DESDEMONA
I have been talking with a suitor hereDESDEMONA
A man that languishes in your displeasure.DESDEMONA
Who is't you mean?OTHELLO
Why your lieutenant Cassio. Good my lordDESDEMONA
If I have any grace or power to move youDESDEMONA
His present reconciliation take;DESDEMONA
For if he be not one that truly loves youDESDEMONA
That errs in ignorance and not in cunningDESDEMONA
I have no judgment in an honest face:DESDEMONA
I prithee call him back.DESDEMONA
Went he hence now?OTHELLO
Ay sooth; so humbledDESDEMONA
That he hath left part of his grief with meDESDEMONA
To suffer with him. Good love call him back.DESDEMONA
Not now sweet Desdemona; some other time.OTHELLO
But shall't be shortly?DESDEMONA
The sooner sweet for you.OTHELLO
Shall't be to-night at supper?DESDEMONA
No not to-night.OTHELLO
To-morrow dinner then?DESDEMONA
I shall not dine at home;OTHELLO
I meet the captains at the citadel.OTHELLO
Why then to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;DESDEMONA
On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn:DESDEMONA
I prithee name the time but let it notDESDEMONA
Exceed three days: in faith he's penitent;DESDEMONA
And yet his trespass in our common reason--DESDEMONA
Save that they say the wars must make examplesDESDEMONA
Out of their best--is not almost a faultDESDEMONA
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?DESDEMONA
Tell me Othello: I wonder in my soulDESDEMONA
What you would ask me that I should denyDESDEMONA
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael CassioDESDEMONA
That came a-wooing with you and so many a timeDESDEMONA
When I have spoke of you dispraisinglyDESDEMONA
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to doDESDEMONA
To bring him in! Trust me I could do much--DESDEMONA
Prithee no more: let him come when he will;OTHELLO
I will deny thee nothing.OTHELLO
Why this is not a boon;DESDEMONA
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your glovesDESDEMONA
Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warmDESDEMONA
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profitDESDEMONA
To your own person: nay when I have a suitDESDEMONA
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeedDESDEMONA
It shall be full of poise and difficult weightDESDEMONA
And fearful to be granted.DESDEMONA
I will deny thee nothing:OTHELLO
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me thisOTHELLO
To leave me but a little to myself.OTHELLO
Shall I deny you? no: farewell my lord.DESDEMONA
Farewell my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.OTHELLO
Emilia come. Be as your fancies teach you;DESDEMONA
Whate'er you be I am obedient.DESDEMONA
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soulOTHELLO
But I do love thee! and when I love thee notOTHELLO
Chaos is come again.OTHELLO
My noble lord--IAGO
                  What dost thou say Iago?OTHELLO
Did Michael Cassio when you woo'd my ladyIAGO
Know of your love?IAGO
He did from first to last: why dost thou ask?OTHELLO
But for a satisfaction of my thought;IAGO
No further harm.IAGO
                  Why of thy thought Iago?OTHELLO
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.IAGO
O yes; and went between us very oft.OTHELLO
Indeed!IAGO
Indeed! ay indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?OTHELLO
Is he not honest?OTHELLO
Honest my lord!IAGO
                  Honest! ay honest.OTHELLO
My lord for aught I know.IAGO
What dost thou think?OTHELLO
Think my lord!IAGO
Think my lord!OTHELLO
By heaven he echoes meOTHELLO
As if there were some monster in his thoughtOTHELLO
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:OTHELLO
I heard thee say even now thou likedst not thatOTHELLO
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?OTHELLO
And when I told thee he was of my counselOTHELLO
In my whole course of wooing thou criedst 'Indeed!'OTHELLO
And didst contract and purse thy brow togetherOTHELLO
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brainOTHELLO
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love meOTHELLO
Show me thy thought.OTHELLO
My lord you know I love you.IAGO
I think thou dost;OTHELLO
And for I know thou'rt full of love and honestyOTHELLO
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breathOTHELLO
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:OTHELLO
For such things in a false disloyal knaveOTHELLO
Are tricks of custom but in a man that's justOTHELLO
They are close delations working from the heartOTHELLO
That passion cannot rule.OTHELLO
For Michael CassioIAGO
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.IAGO
I think so too.OTHELLO
                  Men should be what they seem;IAGO
Or those that be not would they might seem none!IAGO
Certain men should be what they seem.OTHELLO
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.IAGO
Nay yet there's more in this:OTHELLO
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkingsOTHELLO
As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughtsOTHELLO
The worst of words.OTHELLO
Good my lord pardon me:IAGO
Though I am bound to every act of dutyIAGO
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.IAGO
Utter my thoughts? Why say they are vile and false;IAGO
As where's that palace whereinto foul thingsIAGO
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pureIAGO
But some uncleanly apprehensionsIAGO
Keep leets and law-days and in session sitIAGO
With meditations lawful?IAGO
Thou dost conspire against thy friend IagoOTHELLO
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his earOTHELLO
A stranger to thy thoughts.OTHELLO
I do beseech you--IAGO
Though I perchance am vicious in my guessIAGO
As I confess it is my nature's plagueIAGO
To spy into abuses and oft my jealousyIAGO
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yetIAGO
From one that so imperfectly conceitsIAGO
Would take no notice nor build yourself a troubleIAGO
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.IAGO
It were not for your quiet nor your goodIAGO
Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdomIAGO
To let you know my thoughts.IAGO
What dost thou mean?OTHELLO
Good name in man and woman dear my lordIAGO
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:IAGO
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something nothing;IAGO
'Twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands:IAGO
But he that filches from me my good nameIAGO
Robs me of that which not enriches himIAGO
And makes me poor indeed.IAGO
By heaven I'll know thy thoughts.OTHELLO
You cannot if my heart were in your hand;IAGO
Nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody.IAGO
Ha!OTHELLO
O beware my lord of jealousy;IAGO
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mockIAGO
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in blissIAGO
Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger;IAGO
But O what damned minutes tells he o'erIAGO
Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves!IAGO
O misery!OTHELLO
Poor and content is rich and rich enoughIAGO
But riches fineless is as poor as winterIAGO
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.IAGO
Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defendIAGO
From jealousy!IAGO
                  Why why is this?OTHELLO
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousyOTHELLO
To follow still the changes of the moonOTHELLO
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubtOTHELLO
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goatOTHELLO
When I shall turn the business of my soulOTHELLO
To such exsufflicate and blown surmisesOTHELLO
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealousOTHELLO
To say my wife is fair feeds well loves companyOTHELLO
Is free of speech sings plays and dances well;OTHELLO
Where virtue is these are more virtuous:OTHELLO
Nor from mine own weak merits will I drawOTHELLO
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;OTHELLO
For she had eyes and chose me. No Iago;OTHELLO
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt prove;OTHELLO
And on the proof there is no more but this--OTHELLO
Away at once with love or jealousy!OTHELLO
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reasonIAGO
To show the love and duty that I bear youIAGO
With franker spirit: therefore as I am boundIAGO
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.IAGO
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;IAGO
Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure:IAGO
I would not have your free and noble natureIAGO
Out of self-bounty be abused; look to't:IAGO
I know our country disposition well;IAGO
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranksIAGO
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscienceIAGO
Is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown.IAGO
Dost thou say so?OTHELLO
She did deceive her father marrying you;IAGO
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looksIAGO
She loved them most.IAGO
And so she did.OTHELLO
Why go to then;IAGO
She that so young could give out such a seemingIAGO
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-IAGO
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;IAGO
I humbly do beseech you of your pardonIAGO
For too much loving you.IAGO
I am bound to thee for ever.OTHELLO
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.IAGO
Not a jot not a jot.OTHELLO
I' faith I fear it has.IAGO
I hope you will consider what is spokeIAGO
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:IAGO
I am to pray you not to strain my speechIAGO
To grosser issues nor to larger reachIAGO
Than to suspicion.IAGO
I will not.OTHELLO
          Should you do so my lordIAGO
My speech should fall into such vile successIAGO
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--IAGO
My lord I see you're moved.IAGO
No not much moved:OTHELLO
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.OTHELLO
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!IAGO
And yet how nature erring from itself--OTHELLO
Ay there's the point: as--to be bold with you--IAGO
Not to affect many proposed matchesIAGO
Of her own clime complexion and degreeIAGO
Whereto we see in all things nature tends--IAGO
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rankIAGO
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.IAGO
But pardon me; I do not in positionIAGO
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fearIAGO
Her will recoiling to her better judgmentIAGO
May fall to match you with her country formsIAGO
And happily repent.IAGO
Farewell farewell:OTHELLO
If more thou dost perceive let me know more;OTHELLO
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me Iago:OTHELLO
[Going]  My lord I take my leave.IAGO
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtlessOTHELLO
Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds.OTHELLO
[Returning]  My lord I would I might entreatIAGO
your honourIAGO
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:IAGO
Though it be fit that Cassio have his placeIAGO
For sure he fills it up with great abilityIAGO
Yet if you please to hold him off awhileIAGO
You shall by that perceive him and his means:IAGO
Note if your lady strain his entertainmentIAGO
With any strong or vehement importunity;IAGO
Much will be seen in that. In the mean timeIAGO
Let me be thought too busy in my fears--IAGO
As worthy cause I have to fear I am--IAGO
And hold her free I do beseech your honour.IAGO
Fear not my government.OTHELLO
I once more take my leave.IAGO
This fellow's of exceeding honestyOTHELLO
And knows all qualities with a learned spiritOTHELLO
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggardOTHELLO
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstringsOTHELLO
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the windOTHELLO
To pray at fortune. Haply for I am blackOTHELLO
And have not those soft parts of conversationOTHELLO
That chamberers have or for I am declinedOTHELLO
Into the vale of years--yet that's not much--OTHELLO
She's gone. I am abused; and my reliefOTHELLO
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriageOTHELLO
That we can call these delicate creatures oursOTHELLO
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toadOTHELLO
And live upon the vapour of a dungeonOTHELLO
Than keep a corner in the thing I loveOTHELLO
For others' uses. Yet 'tis the plague of great ones;OTHELLO
Prerogatived are they less than the base;OTHELLO
'Tis destiny unshunnable like death:OTHELLO
Even then this forked plague is fated to usOTHELLO
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:OTHELLO
If she be false O then heaven mocks itself!OTHELLO
I'll not believe't.OTHELLO
How now my dear Othello!DESDEMONA
Your dinner and the generous islandersDESDEMONA
By you invited do attend your presence.DESDEMONA
I am to blame.OTHELLO
                  Why do you speak so faintly?DESDEMONA
Are you not well?DESDEMONA
I have a pain upon my forehead here.OTHELLO
'Faith that's with watching; 'twill away again:DESDEMONA
Let me but bind it hard within this hourDESDEMONA
It will be well.DESDEMONA
                  Your napkin is too little:OTHELLO
Let it alone. Come I'll go in with you.OTHELLO
I am very sorry that you are not well.DESDEMONA
I am glad I have found this napkin:EMILIA
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:EMILIA
My wayward husband hath a hundred timesEMILIA
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the tokenEMILIA
For he conjured her she should ever keep itEMILIA
That she reserves it evermore about herEMILIA
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en outEMILIA
And give't Iago: what he will do with itEMILIA
Heaven knows not I;EMILIA
I nothing but to please his fantasy.EMILIA
How now! what do you here alone?IAGO
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.EMILIA
A thing for me? it is a common thing--IAGO
Ha!EMILIA
To have a foolish wife.IAGO
O is that all? What will you give me nowEMILIA
For the same handkerchief?EMILIA
What handkerchief?IAGO
What handkerchief?EMILIA
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;EMILIA
That which so often you did bid me steal.EMILIA
Hast stol'n it from her?IAGO
No 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.EMILIA
And to the advantage I being here took't up.EMILIA
Look here it is.EMILIA
                  A good wench; give it me.IAGO
What will you do with 't that you have beenEMILIA
so earnestEMILIA
To have me filch it?EMILIA
[Snatching it]  Why what's that to you?IAGO
If it be not for some purpose of importEMILIA
Give't me again: poor lady she'll run madEMILIA
When she shall lack it.EMILIA
Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.IAGO
Go leave me.IAGO
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkinIAGO
And let him find it. Trifles light as airIAGO
Are to the jealous confirmations strongIAGO
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.IAGO
The Moor already changes with my poison:IAGO
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons.IAGO
Which at the first are scarce found to distasteIAGO
But with a little act upon the blood.IAGO
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:IAGO
Look where he comes!IAGO
Not poppy nor mandragoraIAGO
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the worldIAGO
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleepIAGO
Which thou owedst yesterday.IAGO
Ha! ha! false to me?OTHELLO
Why how now general! no more of that.IAGO
Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:OTHELLO
I swear 'tis better to be much abusedOTHELLO
Than but to know't a little.OTHELLO
How now my lord!IAGO
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?OTHELLO
I saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me:OTHELLO
I slept the next night well was free and merry;OTHELLO
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:OTHELLO
He that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'nOTHELLO
Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.OTHELLO
I am sorry to hear this.IAGO
I had been happy if the general campOTHELLO
Pioners and all had tasted her sweet bodyOTHELLO
So I had nothing known. O now for everOTHELLO
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!OTHELLO
Farewell the plumed troop and the big warsOTHELLO
That make ambition virtue! O farewell!OTHELLO
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trumpOTHELLO
The spirit-stirring drum the ear-piercing fifeOTHELLO
The royal banner and all qualityOTHELLO
Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war!OTHELLO
And O you mortal engines whose rude throatsOTHELLO
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeitOTHELLO
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!OTHELLO
Is't possible my lord?IAGO
Villain be sure thou prove my love a whoreOTHELLO
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:OTHELLO
Or by the worth of man's eternal soulOTHELLO
Thou hadst been better have been born a dogOTHELLO
Than answer my waked wrath!OTHELLO
Is't come to this?IAGO
Make me to see't; or at the least so prove itOTHELLO
That the probation bear no hinge nor loopOTHELLO
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!OTHELLO
My noble lord--IAGO
If thou dost slander her and torture meOTHELLO
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;OTHELLO
On horror's head horrors accumulate;OTHELLO
Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed;OTHELLO
For nothing canst thou to damnation addOTHELLO
Greater than that.OTHELLO
                  O grace! O heaven forgive me!IAGO
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?IAGO
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.IAGO
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!IAGO
O monstrous world! Take note take note O worldIAGO
To be direct and honest is not safe.IAGO
I thank you for this profit; and from henceIAGO
I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence.IAGO
Nay stay: thou shouldst be honest.OTHELLO
I should be wise for honesty's a foolIAGO
And loses that it works for.IAGO
By the worldOTHELLO
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;OTHELLO
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.OTHELLO
I'll have some proof. Her name that was as freshOTHELLO
As Dian's visage is now begrimed and blackOTHELLO
As mine own face. If there be cords or knivesOTHELLO
Poison or fire or suffocating streamsOTHELLO
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!OTHELLO
I see sir you are eaten up with passion:IAGO
I do repent me that I put it to you.IAGO
You would be satisfied?IAGO
Would! nay I will.OTHELLO
And may: but how? how satisfied my lord?IAGO
Would you the supervisor grossly gape on--IAGO
Behold her topp'd?IAGO
                  Death and damnation! O!OTHELLO
It were a tedious difficulty I thinkIAGO
To bring them to that prospect: damn them thenIAGO
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolsterIAGO
More than their own! What then? how then?IAGO
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?IAGO
It is impossible you should see thisIAGO
Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeysIAGO
As salt as wolves in pride and fools as grossIAGO
As ignorance made drunk. But yet I sayIAGO
If imputation and strong circumstancesIAGO
Which lead directly to the door of truthIAGO
Will give you satisfaction you may have't.IAGO
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.OTHELLO
I do not like the office:IAGO
But sith I am enter'd in this cause so farIAGO
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and loveIAGO
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;IAGO
And being troubled with a raging toothIAGO
I could not sleep.IAGO
There are a kind of men so loose of soulIAGO
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:IAGO
One of this kind is Cassio:IAGO
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet DesdemonaIAGO
Let us be wary let us hide our loves;'IAGO
And then sir would he gripe and wring my handIAGO
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hardIAGO
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the rootsIAGO
That grew upon my lips: then laid his legIAGO
Over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd; and thenIAGO
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'IAGO
O monstrous! monstrous!OTHELLO
Nay this was but his dream.IAGO
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:OTHELLO
'Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream.OTHELLO
And this may help to thicken other proofsIAGO
That do demonstrate thinly.IAGO
I'll tear her all to pieces.OTHELLO
Nay but be wise: yet we see nothing done;IAGO
She may be honest yet. Tell me but thisIAGO
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchiefIAGO
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?IAGO
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.OTHELLO
I know not that; but such a handkerchief--IAGO
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-dayIAGO
See Cassio wipe his beard with.IAGO
If it be that--OTHELLO
If it be that or any that was hersIAGO
It speaks against her with the other proofs.IAGO
O that the slave had forty thousand lives!OTHELLO
One is too poor too weak for my revenge.OTHELLO
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here Iago;OTHELLO
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.OTHELLO
'Tis gone.OTHELLO
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell!OTHELLO
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throneOTHELLO
To tyrannous hate! Swell bosom with thy fraughtOTHELLO
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!OTHELLO
Yet be content.IAGO
O blood blood blood!OTHELLO
Patience I say; your mind perhaps may change.IAGO
Never Iago: Like to the Pontic seaOTHELLO
Whose icy current and compulsive courseOTHELLO
Ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due onOTHELLO
To the Propontic and the HellespontOTHELLO
Even so my bloody thoughts with violent paceOTHELLO
Shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble loveOTHELLO
Till that a capable and wide revengeOTHELLO
Swallow them up. Now by yond marble heavenOTHELLO
In the due reverence of a sacred vowOTHELLO
I here engage my words.OTHELLO
Do not rise yet.IAGO
Witness you ever-burning lights aboveIAGO
You elements that clip us round aboutIAGO
Witness that here Iago doth give upIAGO
The execution of his wit hands heartIAGO
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him commandIAGO
And to obey shall be in me remorseIAGO
What bloody business ever.IAGO
I greet thy loveOTHELLO
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteousOTHELLO
And will upon the instant put thee to't:OTHELLO
Within these three days let me hear thee sayOTHELLO
That Cassio's not alive.OTHELLO
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:IAGO
But let her live.IAGO
Damn her lewd minx! O damn her!OTHELLO
Come go with me apart; I will withdrawOTHELLO
To furnish me with some swift means of deathOTHELLO
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.OTHELLO
I am your own for ever.IAGO
Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies?DESDEMONA
I dare not say he lies any where.Clown
Why man?DESDEMONA
He's a soldier and for one to say a soldier liesClown
is stabbing.Clown
Go to: where lodges he?DESDEMONA
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.Clown
Can any thing be made of this?DESDEMONA
I know not where he lodges and for me to devise aClown
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there wereClown
to lie in mine own throat.Clown
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?DESDEMONA
I will catechise the world for him; that is makeClown
questions and by them answer.Clown
Seek him bid him come hither: tell him I haveDESDEMONA
moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.DESDEMONA
To do this is within the compass of man's wit: andClown
therefore I will attempt the doing it.Clown
Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia?DESDEMONA
I know not madam.EMILIA
Believe me I had rather have lost my purseDESDEMONA
Full of crusadoes: and but my noble MoorDESDEMONA
Is true of mind and made of no such basenessDESDEMONA
As jealous creatures are it were enoughDESDEMONA
To put him to ill thinking.DESDEMONA
Is he not jealous?EMILIA
Who he? I think the sun where he was bornDESDEMONA
Drew all such humours from him.DESDEMONA
Look where he comes.EMILIA
I will not leave him now till CassioDESDEMONA
Be call'd to him.DESDEMONA
How is't with you my lordDESDEMONA
Well my good lady.OTHELLO
O hardness to dissemble!--OTHELLO
How do you Desdemona?OTHELLO
Well my good lord.DESDEMONA
Give me your hand: this hand is moist my lady.OTHELLO
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.DESDEMONA
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:OTHELLO
Hot hot and moist: this hand of yours requiresOTHELLO
A sequester from liberty fasting and prayerOTHELLO
Much castigation exercise devout;OTHELLO
For here's a young and sweating devil hereOTHELLO
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good handOTHELLO
A frank one.OTHELLO
                  You may indeed say so;DESDEMONA
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.DESDEMONA
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;OTHELLO
But our new heraldry is hands not hearts.OTHELLO
I cannot speak of this. Come now your promise.DESDEMONA
What promise chuck?OTHELLO
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.DESDEMONA
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;OTHELLO
Lend me thy handkerchief.OTHELLO
Here my lord.DESDEMONA
That which I gave you.OTHELLO
I have it not about me.DESDEMONA
Not?OTHELLO
   No indeed my lord.DESDEMONA
That is a fault.OTHELLO
That handkerchiefOTHELLO
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;OTHELLO
She was a charmer and could almost readOTHELLO
The thoughts of people: she told her whileOTHELLO
she kept itOTHELLO
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my fatherOTHELLO
Entirely to her love but if she lost itOTHELLO
Or made gift of it my father's eyeOTHELLO
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should huntOTHELLO
After new fancies: she dying gave it me;OTHELLO
And bid me when my fate would have me wiveOTHELLO
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;OTHELLO
Make it a darling like your precious eye;OTHELLO
To lose't or give't away were such perditionOTHELLO
As nothing else could match.OTHELLO
Is't possible?DESDEMONA
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:OTHELLO
A sibyl that had number'd in the worldOTHELLO
The sun to course two hundred compassesOTHELLO
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;OTHELLO
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;OTHELLO
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilfulOTHELLO
Conserved of maidens' hearts.OTHELLO
Indeed! is't true?DESDEMONA
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.OTHELLO
Then would to God that I had never seen't!DESDEMONA
Ha! wherefore?OTHELLO
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?DESDEMONA
Is't lost? is't gone? speak is it outOTHELLO
o' the way?OTHELLO
Heaven bless us!DESDEMONA
Say you?OTHELLO
It is not lost; but what an if it were?DESDEMONA
How!OTHELLO
I say it is not lost.DESDEMONA
Fetch't let me see't.OTHELLO
Why so I can sir but I will not now.DESDEMONA
This is a trick to put me from my suit:DESDEMONA
Pray you let Cassio be received again.DESDEMONA
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.OTHELLO
Come come;DESDEMONA
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.DESDEMONA
The handkerchief!OTHELLO
                  I pray talk me of Cassio.DESDEMONA
The handkerchief!OTHELLO
                  A man that all his timeDESDEMONA
Hath founded his good fortunes on your loveDESDEMONA
Shared dangers with you--DESDEMONA
The handkerchief!OTHELLO
In sooth you are to blame.DESDEMONA
Away!OTHELLO
Is not this man jealous?EMILIA
I ne'er saw this before.DESDEMONA
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief:DESDEMONA
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.DESDEMONA
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:EMILIA
They are all but stomachs and we all but food;EMILIA
To eat us hungerly and when they are fullEMILIA
They belch us. Look you Cassio and my husband!EMILIA
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:IAGO
And lo the happiness! go and importune her.IAGO
How now good Cassio! what's the news with you?DESDEMONA
Madam my former suit: I do beseech youCASSIO
That by your virtuous means I may againCASSIO
Exist and be a member of his loveCASSIO
Whom I with all the office of my heartCASSIO
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.CASSIO
If my offence be of such mortal kindCASSIO
That nor my service past nor present sorrowsCASSIO
Nor purposed merit in futurityCASSIO
Can ransom me into his love againCASSIO
But to know so must be my benefit;CASSIO
So shall I clothe me in a forced contentCASSIO
And shut myself up in some other courseCASSIO
To fortune's alms.CASSIO
                  Alas thrice-gentle Cassio!DESDEMONA
My advocation is not now in tune;DESDEMONA
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know himDESDEMONA
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.DESDEMONA
So help me every spirit sanctifiedDESDEMONA
As I have spoken for you all my bestDESDEMONA
And stood within the blank of his displeasureDESDEMONA
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:DESDEMONA
What I can do I will; and more I willDESDEMONA
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.DESDEMONA
Is my lord angry?IAGO
                  He went hence but nowEMILIA
And certainly in strange unquietness.EMILIA
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannonIAGO
When it hath blown his ranks into the airIAGO
And like the devil from his very armIAGO
Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?IAGO
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:IAGO
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.IAGO
I prithee do so.DESDEMONA
Something sure of stateDESDEMONA
Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practiseDESDEMONA
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to himDESDEMONA
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such casesDESDEMONA
Men's natures wrangle with inferior thingsDESDEMONA
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;DESDEMONA
For let our finger ache and it induesDESDEMONA
Our other healthful members even to that senseDESDEMONA
Of pain: nay we must think men are not godsDESDEMONA
Nor of them look for such observancesDESDEMONA
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much EmiliaDESDEMONA
I was unhandsome warrior as I amDESDEMONA
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;DESDEMONA
But now I find I had suborn'd the witnessDESDEMONA
And he's indicted falsely.DESDEMONA
Pray heaven it be state-matters as you thinkEMILIA
And no conception nor no jealous toyEMILIA
Concerning you.EMILIA
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.DESDEMONA
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;EMILIA
They are not ever jealous for the causeEMILIA
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monsterEMILIA
Begot upon itself born on itself.EMILIA
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!DESDEMONA
Lady amen.EMILIA
I will go seek him. Cassio walk hereabout:DESDEMONA
If I do find him fit I'll move your suitDESDEMONA
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.DESDEMONA
I humbly thank your ladyship.CASSIO
Save you friend Cassio!BIANCA
What make you from home?CASSIO
How is it with you my most fair Bianca?CASSIO
I' faith sweet love I was coming to your house.CASSIO
And I was going to your lodging Cassio.BIANCA
What keep a week away? seven days and nights?BIANCA
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hoursBIANCA
More tedious than the dial eight score times?BIANCA
O weary reckoning!BIANCA
                  Pardon me Bianca:CASSIO
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:CASSIO
But I shall in a more continuate timeCASSIO
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet BiancaCASSIO
Take me this work out.CASSIO
O Cassio whence came this?BIANCA
This is some token from a newer friend:BIANCA
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:BIANCA
Is't come to this? Well well.BIANCA
Go to woman!CASSIO
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teethCASSIO
From whence you have them. You are jealous nowCASSIO
That this is from some mistress some remembrance:CASSIO
No in good troth Bianca.CASSIO
Why whose is it?BIANCA
I know not sweet: I found it in my chamber.CASSIO
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--CASSIO
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:CASSIO
Take it and do't; and leave me for this time.CASSIO
Leave you! wherefore?BIANCA
I do attend here on the general;CASSIO
And think it no addition nor my wishCASSIO
To have him see me woman'd.CASSIO
Why I pray you?BIANCA
Not that I love you not.CASSIO
But that you do not love me.BIANCA
I pray you bring me on the way a littleBIANCA
And say if I shall see you soon at night.BIANCA
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;CASSIO
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.CASSIO
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.BIANCA
Will you think so?IAGO
                  Think so Iago!OTHELLO
WhatIAGO
To kiss in private?IAGO
An unauthorized kiss.OTHELLO
Or to be naked with her friend in bedIAGO
An hour or more not meaning any harm?IAGO
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm!OTHELLO
It is hypocrisy against the devil:OTHELLO
They that mean virtuously and yet do soOTHELLO
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.OTHELLO
So they do nothing 'tis a venial slip:IAGO
But if I give my wife a handkerchief--IAGO
What then?OTHELLO
Why then 'tis hers my lord; and being hersIAGO
She may I think bestow't on any man.IAGO
She is protectress of her honour too:OTHELLO
May she give that?OTHELLO
Her honour is an essence that's not seen;IAGO
They have it very oft that have it not:IAGO
But for the handkerchief--IAGO
By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it.OTHELLO
Thou said'st it comes o'er my memoryOTHELLO
As doth the raven o'er the infected houseOTHELLO
Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.OTHELLO
Ay what of that?IAGO
                  That's not so good now.OTHELLO
WhatIAGO
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?IAGO
Or heard him say--as knaves be such abroadIAGO
Who having by their own importunate suitIAGO
Or voluntary dotage of some mistressIAGO
Convinced or supplied them cannot chooseIAGO
But they must blab--IAGO
Hath he said any thing?OTHELLO
He hath my lord; but be you well assuredIAGO
No more than he'll unswear.IAGO
What hath he said?OTHELLO
'Faith that he did--I know not what he did.IAGO
What? what?OTHELLO
Lie--IAGO
    With her?OTHELLO
With her on her; what you will.IAGO
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her whenOTHELLO
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.OTHELLO
--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--ToOTHELLO
confess and be hanged for his labour;--first to beOTHELLO
hanged and then to confess.--I tremble at it.OTHELLO
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowingOTHELLO
passion without some instruction. It is not wordsOTHELLO
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses ears and lips.OTHELLO
--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--OTHELLO
Work onIAGO
My medicine work! Thus credulous fools are caught;IAGO
And many worthy and chaste dames even thusIAGO
All guiltless meet reproach. What ho! my lord!IAGO
My lord I say! Othello!IAGO
How now Cassio!IAGO
What's the matter?CASSIO
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:IAGO
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.IAGO
Rub him about the temples.CASSIO
No forbear;IAGO
The lethargy must have his quiet course:IAGO
If not he foams at mouth and by and byIAGO
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:IAGO
Do you withdraw yourself a little whileIAGO
He will recover straight: when he is goneIAGO
I would on great occasion speak with you.IAGO
How is it general? have you not hurt your head?IAGO
Dost thou mock me?OTHELLO
                  I mock you! no by heaven.IAGO
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!IAGO
A horned man's a monster and a beast.OTHELLO
There's many a beast then in a populous cityIAGO
And many a civil monster.IAGO
Did he confess it?OTHELLO
                  Good sir be a man;IAGO
Think every bearded fellow that's but yokedIAGO
May draw with you: there's millions now aliveIAGO
That nightly lie in those unproper bedsIAGO
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.IAGO
O 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch-mockIAGO
To lip a wanton in a secure couchIAGO
And to suppose her chaste! No let me know;IAGO
And knowing what I am I know what she shall be.IAGO
O thou art wise; 'tis certain.OTHELLO
Stand you awhile apart;IAGO
Confine yourself but in a patient list.IAGO
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--IAGO
A passion most unsuiting such a man--IAGO
Cassio came hither: I shifted him awayIAGO
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasyIAGO
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;IAGO
The which he promised. Do but encave yourselfIAGO
And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scornsIAGO
That dwell in every region of his face;IAGO
For I will make him tell the tale anewIAGO
Where how how oft how long ago and whenIAGO
He hath and is again to cope your wife:IAGO
I say but mark his gesture. Marry patience;IAGO
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleenIAGO
And nothing of a man.IAGO
Dost thou hear Iago?OTHELLO
I will be found most cunning in my patience;OTHELLO
But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.OTHELLO
That's not amiss;IAGO
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?IAGO
Now will I question Cassio of BiancaIAGO
A housewife that by selling her desiresIAGO
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creatureIAGO
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plagueIAGO
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:IAGO
He when he hears of her cannot refrainIAGO
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:IAGO
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad;IAGO
And his unbookish jealousy must construeIAGO
Poor Cassio's smiles gestures and light behaviorIAGO
Quite in the wrong. How do you now lieutenant?IAGO
The worser that you give me the additionCASSIO
Whose want even kills me.CASSIO
Ply Desdemona well and you are sure on't.IAGO
Now if this suit lay in Bianco's powerIAGO
How quickly should you speed!IAGO
Alas poor caitiff!CASSIO
Look how he laughs already!OTHELLO
I never knew woman love man so.IAGO
Alas poor rogue! I think i' faith she loves me.CASSIO
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.OTHELLO
Do you hear Cassio?IAGO
Now he importunes himOTHELLO
To tell it o'er: go to; well said well said.OTHELLO
She gives it out that you shall marry hey:IAGO
Do you intend it?IAGO
Ha ha ha!CASSIO
Do you triumph Roman? do you triumph?OTHELLO
I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee bear someCASSIO
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.CASSIO
Ha ha ha!CASSIO
So so so so: they laugh that win.OTHELLO
'Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her.IAGO
Prithee say true.CASSIO
I am a very villain else.IAGO
Have you scored me? Well.OTHELLO
This is the monkey's own giving out: she isCASSIO
persuaded I will marry her out of her own love andCASSIO
flattery not out of my promise.CASSIO
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.OTHELLO
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.CASSIO
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank withCASSIO
certain Venetians; and thither comes the baubleCASSIO
and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck--CASSIO
Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gestureOTHELLO
imports it.OTHELLO
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so halesCASSIO
and pulls me: ha ha ha!CASSIO
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. OOTHELLO
I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shallOTHELLO
throw it to.OTHELLO
Well I must leave her company.CASSIO
Before me! look where she comes.IAGO
'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.CASSIO
What do you mean by this haunting of me?CASSIO
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did youBIANCA
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?BIANCA
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out theBIANCA
work?--A likely piece of work that you should findBIANCA
it in your chamber and not know who left it there!BIANCA
This is some minx's token and I must take out theBIANCA
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoeverBIANCA
you had it I'll take out no work on't.BIANCA
How now my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!CASSIO
By heaven that should be my handkerchief!OTHELLO
An you'll come to supper to-night you may; an youBIANCA
will not come when you are next prepared for.BIANCA
After her after her.IAGO
'Faith I must; she'll rail in the street else.CASSIO
Will you sup there?IAGO
'Faith I intend so.CASSIO
Well I may chance to see you; for I would very fainIAGO
speak with you.IAGO
Prithee come; will you?CASSIO
Go to; say no more.IAGO
[Advancing]  How shall I murder him Iago?OTHELLO
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?IAGO
O Iago!OTHELLO
And did you see the handkerchief?IAGO
Was that mine?OTHELLO
Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes theIAGO
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him and heIAGO
hath given it his whore.IAGO
I would have him nine years a-killing.OTHELLO
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!OTHELLO
Nay you must forget that.IAGO
Ay let her rot and perish and be damned to-night;OTHELLO
for she shall not live: no my heart is turned toOTHELLO
stone; I strike it and it hurts my hand. O theOTHELLO
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie byOTHELLO
an emperor's side and command him tasks.OTHELLO
Nay that's not your way.IAGO
Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicateOTHELLO
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! sheOTHELLO
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so highOTHELLO
and plenteous wit and invention:--OTHELLO
She's the worse for all this.IAGO
O a thousand thousand times: and then of soOTHELLO
gentle a condition!OTHELLO
Ay too gentle.IAGO
Nay that's certain: but yet the pity of it Iago!OTHELLO
O Iago the pity of it Iago!OTHELLO
If you are so fond over her iniquity give herIAGO
patent to offend; for if it touch not you it comesIAGO
near nobody.IAGO
I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!OTHELLO
O 'tis foul in her.IAGO
With mine officer!OTHELLO
That's fouler.IAGO
Get me some poison Iago; this night: I'll notOTHELLO
expostulate with her lest her body and beautyOTHELLO
unprovide my mind again: this night Iago.OTHELLO
Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed evenIAGO
the bed she hath contaminated.IAGO
Good good: the justice of it pleases: very good.OTHELLO
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker: youIAGO
shall hear more by midnight.IAGO
Excellent good.OTHELLO
What trumpet is that same?OTHELLO
Something from Venice sure. 'Tis LodovicoIAGO
Come from the duke: and see your wife is with him.IAGO
Save you worthy general!LODOVICO
With all my heart sir.OTHELLO
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.LODOVICO
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.OTHELLO
And what's the news good cousin Lodovico?DESDEMONA
I am very glad to see you signiorIAGO
Welcome to Cyprus.IAGO
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?LODOVICO
Lives sir.IAGO
Cousin there's fall'n between him and my lordDESDEMONA
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.DESDEMONA
Are you sure of that?OTHELLO
My lord?DESDEMONA
[Reads]  'This fail you not to do as you will--'OTHELLO
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.LODOVICO
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?LODOVICO
A most unhappy one: I would do muchDESDEMONA
To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio.DESDEMONA
Fire and brimstone!OTHELLO
My lord?DESDEMONA
       Are you wise?OTHELLO
What is he angry?DESDEMONA
                  May be the letter moved him;LODOVICO
For as I think they do command him homeLODOVICO
Deputing Cassio in his government.LODOVICO
Trust me I am glad on't.DESDEMONA
Indeed!OTHELLO
My lord?DESDEMONA
I am glad to see you mad.OTHELLO
Why sweet Othello--DESDEMONA
[Striking her]  Devil!OTHELLO
I have not deserved this.DESDEMONA
My lord this would not be believed in VeniceLODOVICO
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:LODOVICO
Make her amends; she weeps.LODOVICO
O devil devil!OTHELLO
If that the earth could teem with woman's tearsOTHELLO
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.OTHELLO
Out of my sight!OTHELLO
I will not stay to offend you.DESDEMONA
Truly an obedient lady:LODOVICO
I do beseech your lordship call her back.LODOVICO
Mistress!OTHELLO
        My lord?DESDEMONA
What would you with her sir?OTHELLO
Who I my lord?LODOVICO
Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:OTHELLO
Sir she can turn and turn and yet go onOTHELLO
And turn again; and she can weep sir weep;OTHELLO
And she's obedient as you say obedientOTHELLO
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.OTHELLO
Concerning this sir--O  well-painted passion!--OTHELLO
I am commanded home. Get you away;OTHELLO
I'll send for you anon. Sir I obey the mandateOTHELLO
And will return to Venice. Hence avaunt!OTHELLO
Cassio shall have my place. And sir tonightOTHELLO
I do entreat that we may sup together:OTHELLO
You are welcome sir to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!OTHELLO
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senateLODOVICO
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the natureLODOVICO
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtueLODOVICO
The shot of accident nor dart of chanceLODOVICO
Could neither graze nor pierce?LODOVICO
He is much changed.IAGO
Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?LODOVICO
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censureIAGO
What he might be: if what he might he is notIAGO
I would to heaven he were!IAGO
What strike his wife!LODOVICO
'Faith that was not so well; yet would I knewIAGO
That stroke would prove the worst!IAGO
Is it his use?LODOVICO
Or did the letters work upon his bloodLODOVICO
And new-create this fault?LODOVICO
Alas alas!IAGO
It is not honesty in me to speakIAGO
What I have seen and known. You shall observe himIAGO
And his own courses will denote him soIAGO
That I may save my speech: do but go afterIAGO
And mark how he continues.IAGO
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.LODOVICO
You have seen nothing then?OTHELLO
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect.EMILIA
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together.OTHELLO
But then I saw no harm and then I heardEMILIA
Each syllable that breath made up between them.EMILIA
What did they never whisper?OTHELLO
Never my lord.EMILIA
Nor send you out o' the way?OTHELLO
Never.EMILIA
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing?OTHELLO
Never my lord.EMILIA
That's strange.OTHELLO
I durst my lord to wager she is honestEMILIA
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think otherEMILIA
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.EMILIA
If any wretch have put this in your headEMILIA
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!EMILIA
For if she be not honest chaste and trueEMILIA
There's no man happy; the purest of their wivesEMILIA
Is foul as slander.EMILIA
Bid her come hither: go.OTHELLO
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawdOTHELLO
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whoreOTHELLO
A closet lock and key of villanous secretsOTHELLO
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.OTHELLO
My lord what is your will?DESDEMONA
Pray chuck come hither.OTHELLO
What is your pleasure?DESDEMONA
Let me see your eyes;OTHELLO
Look in my face.OTHELLO
                  What horrible fancy's this?DESDEMONA
[To EMILIA]  Some of your function mistress;OTHELLO
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;OTHELLO
Cough or cry 'hem' if any body come:OTHELLO
Your mystery your mystery: nay dispatch.OTHELLO
Upon my knees what doth your speech import?DESDEMONA
I understand a fury in your words.DESDEMONA
But not the words.DESDEMONA
Why what art thou?OTHELLO
Your wife my lord; your trueDESDEMONA
And loyal wife.DESDEMONA
                  Come swear it damn thyselfOTHELLO
Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselvesOTHELLO
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:OTHELLO
Swear thou art honest.OTHELLO
Heaven doth truly know it.DESDEMONA
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.OTHELLO
To whom my lord? with whom? how am I false?DESDEMONA
O Desdemona! away! away! away!OTHELLO
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?DESDEMONA
Am I the motive of these tears my lord?DESDEMONA
If haply you my father do suspectDESDEMONA
An instrument of this your calling backDESDEMONA
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost himDESDEMONA
Why I have lost him too.DESDEMONA
Had it pleased heavenOTHELLO
To try me with affliction; had they rain'dOTHELLO
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.OTHELLO
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lipsOTHELLO
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopesOTHELLO
I should have found in some place of my soulOTHELLO
A drop of patience: but alas to make meOTHELLO
A fixed figure for the time of scornOTHELLO
To point his slow unmoving finger at!OTHELLO
Yet could I bear that too; well very well:OTHELLO
But there where I have garner'd up my heartOTHELLO
Where either I must live or bear no life;OTHELLO
The fountain from the which my current runsOTHELLO
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!OTHELLO
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toadsOTHELLO
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion thereOTHELLO
Patience thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin--OTHELLO
Ay there look grim as hell!OTHELLO
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.DESDEMONA
O ay; as summer flies are in the shamblesOTHELLO
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weedOTHELLO
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweetOTHELLO
That the sense aches at thee would thou hadstOTHELLO
ne'er been born!OTHELLO
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed?DESDEMONA
Was this fair paper this most goodly bookOTHELLO
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!OTHELLO
Committed! O thou public commoner!OTHELLO
I should make very forges of my cheeksOTHELLO
That would to cinders burn up modestyOTHELLO
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!OTHELLO
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winksOTHELLO
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meetsOTHELLO
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earthOTHELLO
And will not hear it. What committed!OTHELLO
Impudent strumpet!OTHELLO
                  By heaven you do me wrong.DESDEMONA
Are you not a strumpet?OTHELLO
No as I am a Christian:DESDEMONA
If to preserve this vessel for my lordDESDEMONA
From any other foul unlawful touchDESDEMONA
Be not to be a strumpet I am none.DESDEMONA
What not a whore?OTHELLO
                  No as I shall be saved.DESDEMONA
Is't possible?OTHELLO
                  O heaven forgive us!DESDEMONA
I cry you mercy then:OTHELLO
I took you for that cunning whore of VeniceOTHELLO
That married with Othello.OTHELLO
You mistressOTHELLO
That have the office opposite to Saint PeterOTHELLO
And keep the gate of hell!OTHELLO
You you ay you!OTHELLO
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:OTHELLO
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.OTHELLO
Alas what does this gentleman conceive?EMILIA
How do you madam? how do you my good lady?EMILIA
'Faith half asleep.DESDEMONA
Good madam what's the matter with my lord?EMILIA
With who?DESDEMONA
Why with my lord madam.EMILIA
Who is thy lord?DESDEMONA
                  He that is yours sweet lady.EMILIA
I have none: do not talk to me Emilia;DESDEMONA
I cannot weep; nor answer have I noneDESDEMONA
But what should go by water. Prithee tonightDESDEMONA
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;DESDEMONA
And call thy husband hither.DESDEMONA
Here's a change indeed!EMILIA
'Tis meet I should be used so very meet.DESDEMONA
How have I been behaved that he might stickDESDEMONA
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?DESDEMONA
What is your pleasure madam?IAGO
How is't with you?IAGO
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babesDESDEMONA
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:DESDEMONA
He might have chid me so; for in good faithDESDEMONA
I am a child to chiding.DESDEMONA
What's the matter lady?IAGO
Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her.EMILIA
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon herEMILIA
As true hearts cannot bear.EMILIA
Am I that name Iago?DESDEMONA
What name fair lady?IAGO
Such as she says my lord did say I was.DESDEMONA
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drinkEMILIA
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.EMILIA
Why did he so?IAGO
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.DESDEMONA
Do not weep do not weep. Alas the day!IAGO
Hath she forsook so many noble matchesEMILIA
Her father and her country and her friendsEMILIA
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?EMILIA
It is my wretched fortune.DESDEMONA
Beshrew him for't!IAGO
How comes this trick upon him?IAGO
Nay heaven doth know.DESDEMONA
I will be hang'd if some eternal villainEMILIA
Some busy and insinuating rogueEMILIA
Some cogging cozening slave to get some officeEMILIA
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.EMILIA
Fie there is no such man; it is impossible.IAGO
If any such there be heaven pardon him!DESDEMONA
A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!EMILIA
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?EMILIA
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?EMILIA
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knaveEMILIA
Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow.EMILIA
O heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfoldEMILIA
And put in every honest hand a whipEMILIA
To lash the rascals naked through the worldEMILIA
Even from the east to the west!EMILIA
Speak within door.IAGO
O fie upon them! Some such squire he wasEMILIA
That turn'd your wit the seamy side withoutEMILIA
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.EMILIA
You are a fool; go to.IAGO
O good IagoDESDEMONA
What shall I do to win my lord again?DESDEMONA
Good friend go to him; for by this light of heavenDESDEMONA
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:DESDEMONA
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his loveDESDEMONA
Either in discourse of thought or actual deedDESDEMONA
Or that mine eyes mine ears or any senseDESDEMONA
Delighted them in any other form;DESDEMONA
Or that I do not yet and ever did.DESDEMONA
And ever will--though he do shake me offDESDEMONA
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearlyDESDEMONA
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;DESDEMONA
And his unkindness may defeat my lifeDESDEMONA
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'DESDEMONA
It does abhor me now I speak the word;DESDEMONA
To do the act that might the addition earnDESDEMONA
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.DESDEMONA
I pray you be content; 'tis but his humour:IAGO
The business of the state does him offenceIAGO
And he does chide with you.IAGO
If 'twere no other--DESDEMONA
'Tis but so I warrant.IAGO
Hark how these instruments summon to supper!IAGO
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;IAGO
Go in and weep not; all things shall be well.IAGO
How now Roderigo!IAGO
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.RODERIGO
What in the contrary?IAGO
Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago;RODERIGO
and rather as it seems to me now keepest from meRODERIGO
all conveniency than suppliest me with the leastRODERIGO
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endureRODERIGO
it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace whatRODERIGO
already I have foolishly suffered.RODERIGO
Will you hear me Roderigo?IAGO
'Faith I have heard too much for your words andRODERIGO
performances are no kin together.RODERIGO
You charge me most unjustly.IAGO
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out ofRODERIGO
my means. The jewels you have had from me toRODERIGO
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted aRODERIGO
votarist: you have told me she hath received themRODERIGO
and returned me expectations and comforts of suddenRODERIGO
respect and acquaintance but I find none.RODERIGO
Well; go to; very well.IAGO
Very well! go to! I cannot go to man; nor 'tisRODERIGO
not very well: nay I think it is scurvy and beginRODERIGO
to find myself fobbed in it.RODERIGO
Very well.IAGO
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myselfRODERIGO
known to Desdemona: if she will return me myRODERIGO
jewels I will give over my suit and repent myRODERIGO
unlawful solicitation; if not assure yourself IRODERIGO
will seek satisfaction of you.RODERIGO
You have said now.IAGO
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.RODERIGO
Why now I see there's mettle in thee and even fromIAGO
this instant to build on thee a better opinion thanIAGO
ever before. Give me thy hand Roderigo: thou hastIAGO
taken against me a most just exception; but yet IIAGO
protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.IAGO
It hath not appeared.RODERIGO
I grant indeed it hath not appeared and yourIAGO
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. ButIAGO
Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which IIAGO
have greater reason to believe now than ever I meanIAGO
purpose courage and valour this night show it: ifIAGO
thou the next night following enjoy not DesdemonaIAGO
take me from this world with treachery and deviseIAGO
engines for my life.IAGO
Well what is it? is it within reason and compass?RODERIGO
Sir there is especial commission come from VeniceIAGO
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.IAGO
Is that true? why then Othello and DesdemonaRODERIGO
return again to Venice.RODERIGO
O no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away withIAGO
him the fair Desdemona unless his abode beIAGO
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can beIAGO
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.IAGO
How do you mean removing of him?RODERIGO
Why by making him uncapable of Othello's place;IAGO
knocking out his brains.IAGO
And that you would have me to do?RODERIGO
Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.IAGO
He sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will IIAGO
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorableIAGO
fortune. If you will watch his going thence whichIAGO
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and oneIAGO
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be nearIAGO
to second your attempt and he shall fall betweenIAGO
us. Come stand not amazed at it but go along withIAGO
me; I will show you such a necessity in his deathIAGO
that you shall think yourself bound to put it onIAGO
him. It is now high suppertime and the night growsIAGO
to waste: about it.IAGO
I will hear further reason for this.RODERIGO
And you shall be satisfied.IAGO
I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further.LODOVICO
O pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.OTHELLO
Madam good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.LODOVICO
Your honour is most welcome.DESDEMONA
Will you walk sir?OTHELLO
O--Desdemona--OTHELLO
My lord?DESDEMONA
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returnedOTHELLO
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.OTHELLO
I will my lord.DESDEMONA
How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.EMILIA
He says he will return incontinent:DESDEMONA
He hath commanded me to go to bedDESDEMONA
And bade me to dismiss you.DESDEMONA
Dismiss me!EMILIA
It was his bidding: therefore good Emilia.DESDEMONA
Give me my nightly wearing and adieu:DESDEMONA
We must not now displease him.DESDEMONA
I would you had never seen him!EMILIA
So would not I	my love doth so approve himDESDEMONA
That even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns--DESDEMONA
Prithee unpin me--have grace and favour in them.DESDEMONA
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.EMILIA
All's one. Good faith how foolish are our minds!DESDEMONA
If I do die before thee prithee shroud meDESDEMONA
In one of those same sheets.DESDEMONA
Come come you talk.EMILIA
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:DESDEMONA
She was in love and he she loved proved madDESDEMONA
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'DESDEMONA
An old thing 'twas but it express'd her fortuneDESDEMONA
And she died singing it: that song to-nightDESDEMONA
Will not go from my mind; I have much to doDESDEMONA
But to go hang my head all at one sideDESDEMONA
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee dispatch.DESDEMONA
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?EMILIA
No unpin me here.DESDEMONA
This Lodovico is a proper man.DESDEMONA
A very handsome man.EMILIA
He speaks well.DESDEMONA
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefootEMILIA
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.EMILIA
[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore treeDESDEMONA
Sing all a green willow:DESDEMONA
Her hand on her bosom her head on her kneeDESDEMONA
Sing willow willow willow:DESDEMONA
The fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans;DESDEMONA
Sing willow willow willow;DESDEMONA
Her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones;DESDEMONA
Lay by these:--DESDEMONA
Sing willow willow willow;DESDEMONA
Prithee hie thee; he'll come anon:--DESDEMONA
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.DESDEMONA
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve-DESDEMONA
Nay that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?DESDEMONA
It's the wind.EMILIA
[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but whatDESDEMONA
said he then?DESDEMONA
Sing willow willow willow:DESDEMONA
If I court moe women you'll couch with moe men!DESDEMONA
So get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;DESDEMONA
Doth that bode weeping?DESDEMONA
'Tis neither here nor there.EMILIA
I have heard it said so. O these men these men!DESDEMONA
Dost thou in conscience think--tell me Emilia--DESDEMONA
That there be women do abuse their husbandsDESDEMONA
In such gross kind?DESDEMONA
There be some such no question.EMILIA
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?DESDEMONA
Why would not you?EMILIA
No by this heavenly light!DESDEMONA
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;EMILIA
I might do't as well i' the dark.EMILIA
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?DESDEMONA
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.EMILIA
For a small vice.EMILIA
In troth I think thou wouldst not.DESDEMONA
In troth I think I should; and undo't when I hadEMILIA
done. Marry I would not do such a thing for aEMILIA
joint-ring nor for measures of lawn nor forEMILIA
gowns petticoats nor caps nor any pettyEMILIA
exhibition; but for the whole world--why who wouldEMILIA
not make her husband a cuckold to make him aEMILIA
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.EMILIA
Beshrew me if I would do such a wrongDESDEMONA
For the whole world.DESDEMONA
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: andEMILIA
having the world for your labour tis a wrong in yourEMILIA
own world and you might quickly make it right.EMILIA
I do not think there is any such woman.DESDEMONA
Yes a dozen; and as many to the vantage as wouldEMILIA
store the world they played for.EMILIA
But I do think it is their husbands' faultsEMILIA
If wives do fall: say that they slack their dutiesEMILIA
And pour our treasures into foreign lapsEMILIA
Or else break out in peevish jealousiesEMILIA
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike usEMILIA
Or scant our former having in despite;EMILIA
Why we have galls and though we have some graceEMILIA
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands knowEMILIA
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smellEMILIA
And have their palates both for sweet and sourEMILIA
As husbands have. What is it that they doEMILIA
When they change us for others? Is it sport?EMILIA
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?EMILIA
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?EMILIA
It is so too: and have not we affectionsEMILIA
Desires for sport and frailty as men have?EMILIA
Then let them use us well: else let them knowEMILIA
The ills we do their ills instruct us so.EMILIA
Good night good night: heaven me such uses sendDESDEMONA
Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend!DESDEMONA
Here stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:IAGO
Wear thy good rapier bare and put it home:IAGO
Quick quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:IAGO
It makes us or it mars us; think on thatIAGO
And fix most firm thy resolution.IAGO
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.RODERIGO
Here at thy hand: be bold and take thy stand.IAGO
I have no great devotion to the deed;RODERIGO
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:RODERIGO
'Tis but a man gone. Forth my sword: he dies.RODERIGO
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the senseIAGO
And he grows angry. Now whether he kill CassioIAGO
Or Cassio him or each do kill the otherIAGO
Every way makes my gain: live RoderigoIAGO
He calls me to a restitution largeIAGO
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from himIAGO
As gifts to Desdemona;IAGO
It must not be: if Cassio do remainIAGO
He hath a daily beauty in his lifeIAGO
That makes me ugly; and besides the MoorIAGO
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:IAGO
No he must die. But so: I hear him coming.IAGO
I know his gait 'tis he.--Villain thou diest!RODERIGO
That thrust had been mine enemy indeedCASSIO
But that my coat is better than thou know'stCASSIO
I will make proof of thine.CASSIO
O I am slain!RODERIGO
I am maim'd for ever. Help ho! murder! murder!CASSIO
The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.OTHELLO
O villain that I am!RODERIGO
It is even so.OTHELLO
O help ho! light! a surgeon!CASSIO
'Tis he:--O brave Iago honest and justOTHELLO
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!OTHELLO
Thou teachest me. Minion your dear lies deadOTHELLO
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet I come.OTHELLO
Forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted;OTHELLO
Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.OTHELLO
What ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!CASSIO
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.GRATIANO
O help!CASSIO
Hark!LODOVICO
O wretched villain!RODERIGO
Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:LODOVICO
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafeLODOVICO
To come in to the cry without more help.LODOVICO
Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.RODERIGO
Hark!LODOVICO
Here's one comes in his shirt with light and weapons.GRATIANO
Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?IAGO
We do not know.LODOVICO
                  Did not you hear a cry?IAGO
Here here! for heaven's sake help me!CASSIO
What's the matter?IAGO
This is Othello's ancient as I take it.GRATIANO
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.LODOVICO
What are you here that cry so grievously?IAGO
Iago? O I am spoil'd undone by villains!CASSIO
Give me some help.CASSIO
O me lieutenant! what villains have done this?IAGO
I think that one of them is hereaboutCASSIO
And cannot make away.CASSIO
O treacherous villains!IAGO
What are you there? come in and give some help.IAGO
O help me here!RODERIGO
That's one of them.CASSIO
O murderous slave! O villain!IAGO
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!RODERIGO
Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--IAGO
How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--IAGO
What may you be? are you of good or evil?IAGO
As you shall prove us praise us.LODOVICO
Signior Lodovico?IAGO
He sir.LODOVICO
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.IAGO
Cassio!GRATIANO
How is't brother!IAGO
My leg is cut in two.CASSIO
Marry heaven forbid!IAGO
Light gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.IAGO
What is the matter ho? who is't that cried?BIANCA
Who is't that cried!IAGO
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O CassioBIANCA
Cassio Cassio!BIANCA
O notable strumpet! Cassio may you suspectIAGO
Who they should be that have thus many led you?IAGO
No.CASSIO
I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.GRATIANO
Lend me a garter. So. O for a chairIAGO
To bear him easily hence!IAGO
Alas he faints! O Cassio Cassio Cassio!BIANCA
Gentlemen all I do suspect this trashIAGO
To be a party in this injury.IAGO
Patience awhile good Cassio. Come come;IAGO
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?IAGO
Alas my friend and my dear countrymanIAGO
Roderigo! no:--yes sure: O heaven! Roderigo.IAGO
What of Venice?GRATIANO
Even he sir; did you know him?IAGO
Know him! ay.GRATIANO
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;IAGO
These bloody accidents must excuse my mannersIAGO
That so neglected you.IAGO
I am glad to see you.GRATIANO
How do you Cassio? O a chair a chair!IAGO
Roderigo!GRATIANO
He he 'tis he.IAGO
O that's well said; the chair!IAGO
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;GRATIANO
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.GRATIANO
For you mistressGRATIANO
Save you your labour. He that lies slainGRATIANO
here CassioGRATIANO
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?GRATIANO
None in the world; nor do I know the man.CASSIO
[To BIANCA]  What look you pale? O bear him outIAGO
o' the air.IAGO
Stay you good gentlemen. Look you pale mistress?IAGO
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?IAGO
Nay if you stare we shall hear more anon.IAGO
Behold her well; I pray you look upon her:IAGO
Do you see gentlemen? nay guiltiness will speakIAGO
Though tongues were out of use.IAGO
'Las what's the matter? what's the matter husband?EMILIA
Cassio hath here been set on in the darkIAGO
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:IAGO
He's almost slain and Roderigo dead.IAGO
Alas good gentleman! alas good Cassio!EMILIA
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee EmiliaIAGO
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.IAGO
What do you shake at that?IAGO
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.BIANCA
O did he so? I charge you go with me.IAGO
Fie fie upon thee strumpet!EMILIA
I am no strumpet; but of life as honestBIANCA
As you that thus abuse me.BIANCA
As I! foh! fie upon thee!EMILIA
Kind gentlemen let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.IAGO
Come mistress you must tell's another tale.IAGO
Emilia run you to the citadelIAGO
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.IAGO
Will you go on? I pray.IAGO
This is the nightIAGO
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.IAGO
a light burning.IAGO
It is the cause it is the cause my soul--OTHELLO
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars!--OTHELLO
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;OTHELLO
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snowOTHELLO
And smooth as monumental alabaster.OTHELLO
Yet she must die else she'll betray more men.OTHELLO
Put out the light and then put out the light:OTHELLO
If I quench thee thou flaming ministerOTHELLO
I can again thy former light restoreOTHELLO
Should I repent me: but once put out thy lightOTHELLO
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling natureOTHELLO
I know not where is that Promethean heatOTHELLO
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the roseOTHELLO
I cannot give it vital growth again.OTHELLO
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.OTHELLO
Ah balmy breath that dost almost persuadeOTHELLO
Justice to break her sword! One more one more.OTHELLO
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill theeOTHELLO
And love thee after. One more and this the last:OTHELLO
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weepOTHELLO
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;OTHELLO
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.OTHELLO
Who's there? Othello?DESDEMONA
Ay. Desdemona.OTHELLO
Will you come to bed my lord?DESDEMONA
Have you pray'd to-night Desdemona?OTHELLO
Ay my lord.DESDEMONA
If you bethink yourself of any crimeOTHELLO
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and graceOTHELLO
Solicit for it straight.OTHELLO
Alas my lord what do you mean by that?DESDEMONA
Well do it and be brief; I will walk by:OTHELLO
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;OTHELLO
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.OTHELLO
Talk you of killing?DESDEMONA
Ay I do.OTHELLO
Then heavenDESDEMONA
Have mercy on me!DESDEMONA
                  Amen with all my heart!OTHELLO
If you say so I hope you will not kill me.DESDEMONA
Hum!OTHELLO
And yet I fear you; for you are fatal thenDESDEMONA
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know notDESDEMONA
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.DESDEMONA
Think on thy sins.OTHELLO
                  They are loves I bear to you.DESDEMONA
Ay and for that thou diest.OTHELLO
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.DESDEMONA
Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip?DESDEMONA
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:DESDEMONA
These are portents; but yet I hope I hopeDESDEMONA
They do not point on me.DESDEMONA
Peace and be still!OTHELLO
I will so. What's the matter?DESDEMONA
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave theeOTHELLO
Thou gavest to Cassio.OTHELLO
No by my life and soul!DESDEMONA
Send for the man and ask him.DESDEMONA
Sweet soul take heedOTHELLO
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.OTHELLO
Ay but not yet to die.DESDEMONA
Yes presently:OTHELLO
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;OTHELLO
For to deny each article with oathOTHELLO
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conceptionOTHELLO
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.OTHELLO
Then Lord have mercy on me!DESDEMONA
I say amen.OTHELLO
And have you mercy too! I never didDESDEMONA
Offend you in my life; never loved CassioDESDEMONA
But with such general warranty of heavenDESDEMONA
As I might love: I never gave him token.DESDEMONA
By heaven I saw my handkerchief in's hand.OTHELLO
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heartOTHELLO
And makest me call what I intend to doOTHELLO
A murder which I thought a sacrifice:OTHELLO
I saw the handkerchief.OTHELLO
He found it then;DESDEMONA
I never gave it him: send for him hither;DESDEMONA
Let him confess a truth.DESDEMONA
He hath confess'd.OTHELLO
What my lord?DESDEMONA
That he hath used thee.OTHELLO
How? unlawfully?DESDEMONA
Ay.OTHELLO
He will not say so.DESDEMONA
No his mouth is stopp'd;OTHELLO
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.OTHELLO
O! my fear interprets: what is he dead?DESDEMONA
Had all his hairs been lives my great revengeOTHELLO
Had stomach for them all.OTHELLO
Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.DESDEMONA
Out strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?OTHELLO
O banish me my lord but kill me not!DESDEMONA
Down strumpet!OTHELLO
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!DESDEMONA
Nay if you strive--OTHELLO
But half an hour!DESDEMONA
                  Being done there is no pause.OTHELLO
But while I say one prayer!DESDEMONA
It is too late.OTHELLO
[Within]  My lord  my lord! what ho! my lord my lord!EMILIA
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?OTHELLO
I that am cruel am yet merciful;OTHELLO
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So so.OTHELLO
[Within]  What ho! my lord my lord!EMILIA
Who's there?OTHELLO
[Within]  O good my lord I would speak a word with you!EMILIA
Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.OTHELLO
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--OTHELLO
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?OTHELLO
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--OTHELLO
I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?OTHELLO
If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife:OTHELLO
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.OTHELLO
O insupportable! O heavy hour!OTHELLO
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipseOTHELLO
Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globeOTHELLO
Should yawn at alteration.OTHELLO
[Within]  I do beseech youEMILIA
That I may speak with you O good my lord!EMILIA
I had forgot thee: O come in Emilia;OTHELLO
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.OTHELLO
Where art thou?OTHELLO
What's the matter with thee now?OTHELLO
O my good lord yonder's foul murders done!EMILIA
What now?OTHELLO
But now my lord.EMILIA
It is the very error of the moon;OTHELLO
She comes more nearer earth than she was wontOTHELLO
And makes men mad.OTHELLO
Cassio my lord hath kill'd a young VenetianEMILIA
Call'd Roderigo.EMILIA
                  Roderigo kill'd!OTHELLO
And Cassio kill'd!OTHELLO
No Cassio is not kill'd.EMILIA
Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tuneOTHELLO
And sweet revenge grows harsh.OTHELLO
O falsely falsely murder'd!DESDEMONA
Alas what cry is that?EMILIA
That! what?OTHELLO
Out and alas! that was my lady's voice.EMILIA
Help! help ho! help! O lady speak again!EMILIA
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress speak!EMILIA
A guiltless death I die.DESDEMONA
O who hath done this deed?EMILIA
Nobody; I myself. FarewellDESDEMONA
Commend me to my kind lord: O farewell!DESDEMONA
Why how should she be murder'd?OTHELLO
Alas who knows?EMILIA
You heard her say herself it was not I.OTHELLO
She said so: I must needs report the truth.EMILIA
She's like a liar gone to burning hell:OTHELLO
'Twas I that kill'd her.OTHELLO
O the more angel sheEMILIA
And you the blacker devil!EMILIA
She turn'd to folly and she was a whore.OTHELLO
Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil.EMILIA
She was false as water.OTHELLO
Thou art rash as fire to sayEMILIA
That she was false: O she was heavenly true!EMILIA
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.OTHELLO
O I were damn'd beneath all depth in hellOTHELLO
But that I did proceed upon just groundsOTHELLO
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.OTHELLO
My husband!EMILIA
Thy husband.OTHELLO
That she was false to wedlock?EMILIA
Ay with Cassio. Nay had she been trueOTHELLO
If heaven would make me such another worldOTHELLO
Of one entire and Perfect chrysoliteOTHELLO
I'ld not have sold her for it.OTHELLO
My husband!EMILIA
          Ay 'twas he that told me first:OTHELLO
An honest man he is and hates the slimeOTHELLO
That sticks on filthy deeds.OTHELLO
My husband!EMILIA
What needs this iteration woman? I say thy husband.OTHELLO
O mistress villany hath made mocks with loveEMILIA
My husband say that she was false!EMILIA
He woman;OTHELLO
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?OTHELLO
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago.OTHELLO
If he say so may his pernicious soulEMILIA
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:EMILIA
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.EMILIA
Ha!OTHELLO
Do thy worst:EMILIA
This deed of thine is no more worthy heavenEMILIA
Than thou wast worthy her.EMILIA
Peace you were best.OTHELLO
Thou hast not half that power to do me harmEMILIA
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!EMILIA
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--EMILIA
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee knownEMILIA
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help ho! help!EMILIA
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!EMILIA
What is the matter? How now general!MONTANO
O are you come Iago? you have done wellEMILIA
That men must lay their murders on your neck.EMILIA
What is the matter?GRATIANO
Disprove this villain if thou be'st a man:EMILIA
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:EMILIA
I know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain:EMILIA
Speak for my heart is full.EMILIA
I told him what I thought and told no moreIAGO
Than what he found himself was apt and true.IAGO
But did you ever tell him she was false?EMILIA
I did.IAGO
You told a lie an odious damned lie;EMILIA
Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie.EMILIA
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?EMILIA
With Cassio mistress. Go to charm your tongue.IAGO
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:EMILIA
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed--EMILIA
O heavens forfend!All
And your reports have set the murder on.EMILIA
Nay stare not masters: it is true indeed.OTHELLO
'Tis a strange truth.GRATIANO
O monstrous act!MONTANO
                  Villany villany villany!EMILIA
I think upon't I think: I smell't: O villany!--EMILIA
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--EMILIA
O villany villany!EMILIA
What are you mad? I charge you get you home.IAGO
Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak:EMILIA
'Tis proper I obey him but not now.EMILIA
Perchance Iago I will ne'er go home.EMILIA
O! O! O!OTHELLO
       Nay lay thee down and roar;EMILIA
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocentEMILIA
That e'er did lift up eye.EMILIA
[Rising]  O she was foul!OTHELLO
I scarce did know you uncle: there lies your nieceOTHELLO
Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd:OTHELLO
I know this act shows horrible and grim.OTHELLO
Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:GRATIANO
Thy match was mortal to him and pure griefGRATIANO
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live nowGRATIANO
This sight would make him do a desperate turnGRATIANO
Yea curse his better angel from his sideGRATIANO
And fall to reprobation.GRATIANO
'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knowsOTHELLO
That she with Cassio hath the act of shameOTHELLO
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:OTHELLO
And she did gratify his amorous worksOTHELLO
With that recognizance and pledge of loveOTHELLO
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:OTHELLO
It was a handkerchief an antique tokenOTHELLO
My father gave my mother.OTHELLO
O heaven! O heavenly powers!EMILIA
Come hold your peace.IAGO
'Twill out 'twill out: I peace!EMILIA
No I will speak as liberal as the north:EMILIA
Let heaven and men and devils let them allEMILIA
All all cry shame against me yet I'll speak.EMILIA
Be wise and get you home.IAGO
I will not.EMILIA
Fie!GRATIANO
Your sword upon a woman?GRATIANO
O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st ofEMILIA
I found by fortune and did give my husband;EMILIA
For often with a solemn earnestnessEMILIA
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifleEMILIA
He begg'd of me to steal it.EMILIA
Villanous whore!IAGO
She give it Cassio! no alas! I found itEMILIA
And I did give't my husband.EMILIA
Filth thou liest!IAGO
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen.EMILIA
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a foolEMILIA
Do with so good a woman?EMILIA
Are there no stones in heavenOTHELLO
But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!OTHELLO
The woman falls; sure he hath kill'd his wife.GRATIANO
Ay ay: O lay me by my mistress' side.EMILIA
He's gone but his wife's kill'd.GRATIANO
'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weaponMONTANO
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:MONTANO
Come guard the door without; let him not passMONTANO
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villainMONTANO
For 'tis a damned slave.MONTANO
I am not valiant neitherOTHELLO
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:OTHELLO
But why should honour outlive honesty?OTHELLO
Let it go all.OTHELLO
What did thy song bode lady?EMILIA
Hark canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.EMILIA
And die in music.EMILIA
Willow willow willow--EMILIA
Moor she was chaste; she loved thee cruel Moor;EMILIA
So come my soul to bliss as I speak true;EMILIA
So speaking as I think I die I die.EMILIA
I have another weapon in this chamber;OTHELLO
It is a sword of Spain the ice-brook's temper:--OTHELLO
O here it is. Uncle I must come forth.OTHELLO
[Within]  If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear:GRATIANO
Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.GRATIANO
Look in upon me then and speak with meOTHELLO
Or naked as I am I will assault thee.OTHELLO
What is the matter?GRATIANO
Behold I have a weapon;OTHELLO
A better never did itself sustainOTHELLO
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the dayOTHELLO
That with this little arm and this good swordOTHELLO
I have made my way through more impedimentsOTHELLO
Than twenty times your stop: but O vain boast!OTHELLO
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.OTHELLO
Be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd;OTHELLO
Here is my journey's end here is my buttOTHELLO
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.OTHELLO
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;OTHELLO
Man but a rush against Othello's breastOTHELLO
And he retires. Where should Othello go?OTHELLO
Now how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!OTHELLO
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at comptOTHELLO
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heavenOTHELLO
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold cold my girl!OTHELLO
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!OTHELLO
Whip me ye devilsOTHELLO
From the possession of this heavenly sight!OTHELLO
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!OTHELLO
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!OTHELLO
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!OTHELLO
Oh! Oh! Oh!OTHELLO
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?LODOVICO
That's he that was Othello: here I am.OTHELLO
Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.LODOVICO
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.OTHELLO
If that thou best a devil I cannot kill thee.OTHELLO
Wrench his sword from him.LODOVICO
I bleed sir; but not kill'd.IAGO
I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;OTHELLO
For in my sense 'tis happiness to die.OTHELLO
O thou Othello thou wert once so goodLODOVICO
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slaveLODOVICO
What shall be said to thee?LODOVICO
Why any thing:OTHELLO
An honourable murderer if you will;OTHELLO
For nought I did in hate but all in honour.OTHELLO
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:LODOVICO
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?LODOVICO
Ay.OTHELLO
Dear general I never gave you cause.CASSIO
I do believe it and I ask your pardon.OTHELLO
Will you I pray demand that demi-devilOTHELLO
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?OTHELLO
Demand me nothing: what you know you know:IAGO
From this time forth I never will speak word.IAGO
What not to pray?LODOVICO
                  Torments will ope your lips.GRATIANO
Well thou dost best.OTHELLO
Sir you shall understand what hath befall'nLODOVICO
Which as I think you know not. Here is a letterLODOVICO
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;LODOVICO
And here another: the one of them importsLODOVICO
The death of Cassio to be undertookLODOVICO
By Roderigo.LODOVICO
O villain!OTHELLO
Most heathenish and most gross!CASSIO
Now here's another discontented paperLODOVICO
Found in his pocket too; and this it seemsLODOVICO
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;LODOVICO
But that belike Iago in the interimLODOVICO
Came in and satisfied him.LODOVICO
O the pernicious caitiff!OTHELLO
How came you Cassio by that handkerchiefOTHELLO
That was my wife's?OTHELLO
I found it in my chamber:CASSIO
And he himself confess'd but even nowCASSIO
That there he dropp'd it for a special purposeCASSIO
Which wrought to his desire.CASSIO
O fool! fool! fool!OTHELLO
There is besides in Roderigo's letterCASSIO
How he upbraids Iago that he made himCASSIO
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it cameCASSIO
That I was cast: and even but now he spakeCASSIO
After long seeming dead Iago hurt himCASSIO
Iago set him on.CASSIO
You must forsake this room and go with us:LODOVICO
Your power and your command is taken offLODOVICO
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slaveLODOVICO
If there be any cunning crueltyLODOVICO
That can torment him much and hold him longLODOVICO
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner restLODOVICO
Till that the nature of your fault be knownLODOVICO
To the Venetian state. Come bring him away.LODOVICO
Soft you; a word or two before you go.OTHELLO
I have done the state some service and they know't.OTHELLO
No more of that. I pray you in your lettersOTHELLO
When you shall these unlucky deeds relateOTHELLO
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuateOTHELLO
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speakOTHELLO
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;OTHELLO
Of one not easily jealous but being wroughtOTHELLO
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose handOTHELLO
Like the base Indian threw a pearl awayOTHELLO
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyesOTHELLO
Albeit unused to the melting moodOTHELLO
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian treesOTHELLO
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;OTHELLO
And say besides that in Aleppo onceOTHELLO
Where a malignant and a turban'd TurkOTHELLO
Beat a Venetian and traduced the stateOTHELLO
I took by the throat the circumcised dogOTHELLO
And smote him thus.OTHELLO
O bloody period!LODOVICO
                  All that's spoke is marr'd.GRATIANO
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;OTHELLO
Killing myself to die upon a kiss.OTHELLO
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon;CASSIO
For he was great of heart.CASSIO
[To IAGO]  O Spartan dogLODOVICO
More fell than anguish hunger or the sea!LODOVICO
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;LODOVICO
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;LODOVICO
Let it be hid. Gratiano keep the houseLODOVICO
And seize upon the fortunes of the MoorLODOVICO
For they succeed on you. To you lord governorLODOVICO
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;LODOVICO
The time the place the torture: O enforce it!LODOVICO
Myself will straight aboard: and to the stateLODOVICO
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.LODOVICO
