,My name is Roderigo.,RODERIGO
,The worser welcome:,BRABANTIO
,I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:,BRABANTIO
,In honest plainness thou hast heard me say,BRABANTIO
,"My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,",BRABANTIO
,"Being full of supper and distempering draughts,",BRABANTIO
,"Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come",BRABANTIO
,To start my quiet.,BRABANTIO
,"Sir, sir, sir,--",RODERIGO
,                  But thou must needs be sure,BRABANTIO
,My spirit and my place have in them power,BRABANTIO
,To make this bitter to thee.,BRABANTIO
,"Patience, good sir.",RODERIGO
,What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;,BRABANTIO
,My house is not a grange.,BRABANTIO
,"Most grave Brabantio,",RODERIGO
,In simple and pure soul I come to you.,RODERIGO
,"'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not",IAGO
,"serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to",IAGO
,"do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll",IAGO
,have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;,IAGO
,you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have,IAGO
,coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.,IAGO
,What profane wretch art thou?,BRABANTIO
,"I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter",IAGO
,and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.,IAGO
,Thou art a villain.,BRABANTIO
,You are--a senator.,IAGO
,"This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.",BRABANTIO
,"Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,",RODERIGO
,"If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,",RODERIGO
,"As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,",RODERIGO
,"At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,",RODERIGO
,"Transported, with no worse nor better guard",RODERIGO
,"But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,",RODERIGO
,To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--,RODERIGO
,"If this be known to you and your allowance,",RODERIGO
,We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;,RODERIGO
,"But if you know not this, my manners tell me",RODERIGO
,We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe,RODERIGO
,"That, from the sense of all civility,",RODERIGO
,I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:,RODERIGO
,"Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,",RODERIGO
,"I say again, hath made a gross revolt;",RODERIGO
,"Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes",RODERIGO
,In an extravagant and wheeling stranger,RODERIGO
,Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:,RODERIGO
,"If she be in her chamber or your house,",RODERIGO
,Let loose on me the justice of the state,RODERIGO
,For thus deluding you.,RODERIGO
,"Strike on the tinder, ho!",BRABANTIO
,Give me a taper! call up all my people!,BRABANTIO
,This accident is not unlike my dream:,BRABANTIO
,Belief of it oppresses me already.,BRABANTIO
,"Light, I say! light!",BRABANTIO
,Farewell; for I must leave you:,IAGO
,"It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,",IAGO
,"To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--",IAGO
,"Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,",IAGO
,"However this may gall him with some cheque,",IAGO
,"Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd",IAGO
,"With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,",IAGO
,"Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,",IAGO
,"Another of his fathom they have none,",IAGO
,"To lead their business: in which regard,",IAGO
,Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.,IAGO
,"Yet, for necessity of present life,",IAGO
,"I must show out a flag and sign of love,",IAGO
,"Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,",IAGO
,Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;,IAGO
,"And there will I be with him. So, farewell.",IAGO
,It is too true an evil: gone she is;,BRABANTIO
,And what's to come of my despised time,BRABANTIO
,"Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,",BRABANTIO
,Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!,BRABANTIO
,"With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!",BRABANTIO
,How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me,BRABANTIO
,Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:,BRABANTIO
,"Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?",BRABANTIO
,"Truly, I think they are.",RODERIGO
,O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!,BRABANTIO
,"Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds",BRABANTIO
,By what you see them act. Is there not charms,BRABANTIO
,By which the property of youth and maidhood,BRABANTIO
,"May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,",BRABANTIO
,Of some such thing?,BRABANTIO
,"Yes, sir, I have indeed.",RODERIGO
,"Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!",BRABANTIO
,"Some one way, some another. Do you know",BRABANTIO
,Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?,BRABANTIO
,"I think I can discover him, if you please,",RODERIGO
,To get good guard and go along with me.,RODERIGO
,"Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;",BRABANTIO
,"I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!",BRABANTIO
,And raise some special officers of night.,BRABANTIO
,"On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.",BRABANTIO
"Though in the trade of war I have slain men,",IAGO
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience,IAGO
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity,IAGO
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times,IAGO
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.,IAGO
'Tis better as it is.,OTHELLO
"Nay, but he prated,",IAGO
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms,IAGO
Against your honour,IAGO
,"That, with the little godliness I have,",IAGO
,"I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,",IAGO
,"Are you fast married? Be assured of this,",IAGO
,"That the magnifico is much beloved,",IAGO
,And hath in his effect a voice potential,IAGO
,As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;,IAGO
,Or put upon you what restraint and grievance,IAGO
,"The law, with all his might to enforce it on,",IAGO
,Will give him cable.,IAGO
,Let him do his spite:,OTHELLO
,My services which I have done the signiory,OTHELLO

,Something from Cyprus as I may divine:,CASSIO

,"O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?",BRABANTIO

,"What say'st thou, noble heart?",IAGO
,"What will I do, thinkest thou?",RODERIGO
,"Why, go to bed, and sleep.",IAGO
,I will incontinently drown myself.,RODERIGO
,"If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,",IAGO
,thou silly gentleman!,IAGO
,It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and,RODERIGO
,then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.,RODERIGO
,O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four,IAGO
,times seven years; and since I could distinguish,IAGO
,"betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man",IAGO
,"that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I",IAGO
,"would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I",IAGO
,would change my humanity with a baboon.,IAGO
,What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so,RODERIGO
,fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.,RODERIGO
,Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus,IAGO
,"or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which",IAGO
,our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant,IAGO
,"nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up",IAGO
,"thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or",IAGO
,"distract it with many, either to have it sterile",IAGO
,"with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the",IAGO
,power and corrigible authority of this lies in our,IAGO
,wills. If the balance of our lives had not one,IAGO
,"scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the",IAGO
,blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us,IAGO
,to most preposterous conclusions: but we have,IAGO
,"reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal",IAGO
,"stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that",IAGO
,you call love to be a sect or scion.,IAGO
,It cannot be.,RODERIGO
,It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of,IAGO
,"the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown",IAGO
,cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy,IAGO
,friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with,IAGO
,cables of perdurable toughness; I could never,IAGO
,better stead thee than now. Put money in thy,IAGO
,purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with,IAGO
,"an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It",IAGO
,cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her,IAGO
,"love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he",IAGO
,"his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou",IAGO
,shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but,IAGO
,money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in,IAGO
,their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food,IAGO
,"that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be",IAGO
,to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must,IAGO
,"change for youth: when she is sated with his body,",IAGO
,she will find the error of her choice: she must,IAGO
,"have change, she must: therefore put money in thy",IAGO
,"purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a",IAGO
,more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money,IAGO
,thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt,IAGO
,an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not,IAGO
,"too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou",IAGO
,shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of,IAGO
,drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek,IAGO
,thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than,IAGO
,to be drowned and go without her.,IAGO
,"Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on",RODERIGO
,the issue?,RODERIGO
,"Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told",IAGO
,"thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I",IAGO
,hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no,IAGO
,less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge,IAGO
,"against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost",IAGO
,"thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many",IAGO

,"give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,",IAGO
,"sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which",IAGO
,"the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these",IAGO
,"required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will",IAGO

,"choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most",IAGO
,pregnant and unforced position--who stands so,IAGO
,eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio,IAGO
,does? a knave very voluble; no further,IAGO
,conscionable than in putting on the mere form of,IAGO
,"civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing",IAGO

,"none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a",IAGO
,"finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and",IAGO
,"counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never",IAGO
,"present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the",IAGO
,"knave is handsome, young, and hath all those",IAGO
,requisites in him that folly and green minds look,IAGO
,after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman,IAGO
,hath found him already.,IAGO
,I cannot believe that in her; she's full of,RODERIGO

,Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of,IAGO

,not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst,IAGO
,not mark that?,IAGO
,"Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.",RODERIGO
,"Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue",IAGO
,to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met,IAGO
,so near with their lips that their breaths embraced,IAGO

,have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;,IAGO
,"for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows",IAGO
,you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find,IAGO
,"some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking",IAGO
,"too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what",IAGO
,"other course you please, which the time shall more",IAGO
,favourably minister.,IAGO
,Well.,RODERIGO
,"Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply",IAGO
,"may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for",IAGO
,even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to,IAGO
,mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true,IAGO
,taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So,IAGO
,shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by,IAGO
,the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the,IAGO
,"impediment most profitably removed, without the",IAGO
,which there were no expectation of our prosperity.,IAGO

,had he done to you?,IAGO
,I know not.,CASSIO
,Is't possible?,IAGO
,"I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;",CASSIO

,"their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance",CASSIO
,"revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!",CASSIO
,"Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus",IAGO
,recovered?,IAGO
,It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place,CASSIO

,I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me,CASSIO
,"I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,",CASSIO

,"Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,",IAGO

,"And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.",IAGO
,"I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!",CASSIO
,"You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.",IAGO
,I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife,IAGO
,"is now the general: may say so in this respect, for",IAGO
,that he hath devoted and given up himself to the,IAGO
,"contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and",IAGO
,graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune,IAGO
,her help to put you in your place again: she is of,IAGO
,"so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,",IAGO
,she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more,IAGO
,than she is requested: this broken joint between,IAGO
,"you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my",IAGO
,"fortunes against any lay worth naming, this",IAGO
,crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.,IAGO
,You advise me well.,CASSIO
,"I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.",IAGO
,I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will,CASSIO
,beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:,CASSIO
,I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.,CASSIO
,"You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I",IAGO
,must to the watch.,IAGO
,"CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.",IAGO
,And what's he then that says I play the villain?,IAGO
,"When this advice is free I give and honest,",IAGO
,Probal to thinking and indeed the course,IAGO
,To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy,IAGO
,The inclining Desdemona to subdue,IAGO
,In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful,IAGO
,As the free elements. And then for her,IAGO
,"To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,",IAGO
,"All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,",IAGO
,"His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,",IAGO
,"That she may make, unmake, do what she list,",IAGO
,Even as her appetite shall play the god,IAGO
,With his weak function. How am I then a villain,IAGO
,"To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,",IAGO
,Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!,IAGO
,"When devils will the blackest sins put on,",IAGO
,"They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,",IAGO
,As I do now: for whiles this honest fool,IAGO
,Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,IAGO
,"And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,",IAGO
,"I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,",IAGO
,That she repeals him for her body's lust;,IAGO
,"And by how much she strives to do him good,",IAGO
,She shall undo her credit with the Moor.,IAGO
,"So will I turn her virtue into pitch,",IAGO
,And out of her own goodness make the net,IAGO
,That shall enmesh them all.,IAGO
,"How now, Roderigo!",IAGO
,"I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that",RODERIGO
,"hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is",RODERIGO
,almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well,RODERIGO
,"cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall",RODERIGO
,"have so much experience for my pains, and so, with",RODERIGO
,"no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.",RODERIGO
,How poor are they that have not patience!,IAGO
,What wound did ever heal but by degrees?,IAGO
,"Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;",IAGO
,And wit depends on dilatory time.,IAGO
,Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.,IAGO
,"And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:",IAGO
,"Though other things grow fair against the sun,",IAGO
,Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:,IAGO
,"Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;",IAGO
,Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.,IAGO
,Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:,IAGO
,"Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:",IAGO
,"Nay, get thee gone.",IAGO
,Two things are to be done:,IAGO
,My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;,IAGO
,I'll set her on;,IAGO
,"Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,",IAGO
,And bring him jump when he may Cassio find,IAGO
,"Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way",IAGO
,Dull not device by coldness and delay.,IAGO
,"Masters, play here; I will content your pains;",CASSIO
,"Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'",CASSIO
,"Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,",Clown
,that they speak i' the nose thus?,Clown
,"How, sir, how!",First Musician
,"Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?",Clown
,"Ay, marry, are they, sir.",First Musician
,"O, thereby hangs a tail.",Clown
,"Whereby hangs a tale, sir?",First Musician
,"Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.",Clown
,"But, masters, here's money for you: and the general",Clown
,"so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's",Clown
,"sake, to make no more noise with it.",Clown
,"Well, sir, we will not.",First Musician
,"If you have any music that may not be heard, to't",Clown
,"again: but, as they say to hear music the general",Clown
,does not greatly care.,Clown
,"We have none such, sir.",First Musician
,"Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:",Clown
,go; vanish into air; away!,Clown
,"Dost thou hear, my honest friend?",CASSIO
,"No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.",Clown
,"Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece",CASSIO
,of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends,CASSIO
,"the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's",CASSIO
,one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:,CASSIO
,wilt thou do this?,CASSIO
,"She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I",Clown
,shall seem to notify unto her.,Clown
,"Do, good my friend.",CASSIO
,"In happy time, Iago.",CASSIO
,"You have not been a-bed, then?",IAGO
,"Why, no; the day had broke",CASSIO
,"Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,",CASSIO
,To send in to your wife: my suit to her,CASSIO
,"Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona",CASSIO
,Procure me some access.,CASSIO
,I'll send her to you presently;,IAGO
,And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor,IAGO
,"Out of the way, that your converse and business",IAGO
,May be more free.,IAGO
,I humbly thank you for't.,CASSIO
,I never knew,CASSIO
,A Florentine more kind and honest.,CASSIO
,"Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry",EMILIA
,For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.,EMILIA
,The general and his wife are talking of it;,EMILIA
,"And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,",EMILIA
,"That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,",EMILIA
,"And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom",EMILIA
,He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you,EMILIA
,And needs no other suitor but his likings,EMILIA
,To take the safest occasion by the front,EMILIA
,To bring you in again.,EMILIA
,"Yet, I beseech you,",CASSIO
,"If you think fit, or that it may be done,",CASSIO
,Give me advantage of some brief discourse,CASSIO
,With Desdemona alone.,CASSIO
,"Pray you, come in;",EMILIA
,I will bestow you where you shall have time,EMILIA
,To speak your bosom freely.,EMILIA
,I am much bound to you.,CASSIO

,I am glad I have found this napkin:,EMILIA
,This was her first remembrance from the Moor:,EMILIA

,To have a foolish wife.,IAGO
,"O, is that all? What will you give me now",EMILIA

,What handkerchief?,IAGO
,What handkerchief?,EMILIA
,"Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;",EMILIA

,                  A good wench; give it me.,IAGO

,When she shall lack it.,EMILIA
,Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.,IAGO
,"Go, leave me.",IAGO

,"How now, my lord!",IAGO
,What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?,OTHELLO
,"I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:",OTHELLO
,"I slept the next night well, was free and merry;",OTHELLO

,Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?,IAGO
,God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.,IAGO
,That livest to make thine honesty a vice!,IAGO
,"O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,",IAGO
,To be direct and honest is not safe.,IAGO
,I thank you for this profit; and from hence,IAGO
,"I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.",IAGO
,"Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.",OTHELLO
,"I should be wise, for honesty's a fool",IAGO
,And loses that it works for.,IAGO
,"By the world,",OTHELLO
,I think my wife be honest and think she is not;,OTHELLO
,I think that thou art just and think thou art not.,OTHELLO
,"I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh",OTHELLO
,"As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black",OTHELLO
,"As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,",OTHELLO
,"Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,",OTHELLO
,I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!,OTHELLO
,"I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:",IAGO
,I do repent me that I put it to you.,IAGO
,You would be satisfied?,IAGO
,"Would! nay, I will.",OTHELLO
,"And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?",IAGO
,"Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--",IAGO
,Behold her topp'd?,IAGO
,                  Death and damnation! O!,OTHELLO
,"It were a tedious difficulty, I think,",IAGO
,"To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,",IAGO
,If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster,IAGO
,More than their own! What then? how then?,IAGO
,What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?,IAGO
,"It is impossible you should see this,",IAGO
,"Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,",IAGO
,"As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross",IAGO
,"As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,",IAGO
,"If imputation and strong circumstances,",IAGO
,"Which lead directly to the door of truth,",IAGO
,"Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.",IAGO
,Give me a living reason she's disloyal.,OTHELLO
,I do not like the office:,IAGO
,"But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,",IAGO
,"Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,",IAGO
,I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;,IAGO
,"And, being troubled with a raging tooth,",IAGO
,I could not sleep.,IAGO
,"There are a kind of men so loose of soul,",IAGO
,That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:,IAGO
,One of this kind is Cassio:,IAGO
,"In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,",IAGO
,"Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'",IAGO
,"And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,",IAGO
,"Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,",IAGO
,As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,IAGO
,That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg,IAGO
,"Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then",IAGO
,Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!',IAGO
,O monstrous! monstrous!,OTHELLO
,"Nay, this was but his dream.",IAGO
,But this denoted a foregone conclusion:,OTHELLO
,"'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.",OTHELLO
,And this may help to thicken other proofs,IAGO
,That do demonstrate thinly.,IAGO
,I'll tear her all to pieces.,OTHELLO
,"Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;",IAGO
,"She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,",IAGO
,Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief,IAGO
,Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?,IAGO
,I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.,OTHELLO
,I know not that; but such a handkerchief--,IAGO
,I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day,IAGO
,See Cassio wipe his beard with.,IAGO
,If it be that--,OTHELLO
,"If it be that, or any that was hers,",IAGO
,It speaks against her with the other proofs.,IAGO
,"O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!",OTHELLO
,"One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.",OTHELLO
,"Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;",OTHELLO
,All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.,OTHELLO
,'Tis gone.,OTHELLO
,"Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!",OTHELLO
,"Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne",OTHELLO
,"To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,",OTHELLO
,For 'tis of aspics' tongues!,OTHELLO
,Yet be content.,IAGO
,"O, blood, blood, blood!",OTHELLO
,"Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.",IAGO
,"Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,",OTHELLO
,Whose icy current and compulsive course,OTHELLO
,"Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on",OTHELLO
,"To the Propontic and the Hellespont,",OTHELLO
,"Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,",OTHELLO
,"Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,",OTHELLO
,Till that a capable and wide revenge,OTHELLO
,"Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,",OTHELLO
,In the due reverence of a sacred vow,OTHELLO
,I here engage my words.,OTHELLO
,Do not rise yet.,IAGO
,"Witness, you ever-burning lights above,",IAGO
,"You elements that clip us round about,",IAGO
,Witness that here Iago doth give up,IAGO
,"The execution of his wit, hands, heart,",IAGO
,"To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,",IAGO
,"And to obey shall be in me remorse,",IAGO
,What bloody business ever.,IAGO
,"I greet thy love,",OTHELLO
,"Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,",OTHELLO
,And will upon the instant put thee to't:,OTHELLO
,Within these three days let me hear thee say,OTHELLO
,That Cassio's not alive.,OTHELLO
,My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:,IAGO
,But let her live.,IAGO
,"Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!",OTHELLO
,"Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,",OTHELLO
,To furnish me with some swift means of death,OTHELLO
,For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.,OTHELLO
,I am your own for ever.,IAGO
,"Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?",DESDEMONA
,I dare not say he lies any where.,Clown
,"Why, man?",DESDEMONA
,"He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,",Clown
,is stabbing.,Clown
,Go to: where lodges he?,DESDEMONA
,"To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.",Clown
,Can any thing be made of this?,DESDEMONA
,"I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a",Clown
,"lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were",Clown
,to lie in mine own throat.,Clown
,"Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?",DESDEMONA
,"I will catechise the world for him; that is, make",Clown
,"questions, and by them answer.",Clown
,"Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have",DESDEMONA
,"moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.",DESDEMONA
,To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and,Clown
,therefore I will attempt the doing it.,Clown
,"Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?",DESDEMONA
,"I know not, madam.",EMILIA
,"Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse",DESDEMONA
,"Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor",DESDEMONA
,Is true of mind and made of no such baseness,DESDEMONA
,"As jealous creatures are, it were enough",DESDEMONA
,To put him to ill thinking.,DESDEMONA
,Is he not jealous?,EMILIA
,"Who, he? I think the sun where he was born",DESDEMONA
,Drew all such humours from him.,DESDEMONA
,"Look, where he comes.",EMILIA

,"How do you, Desdemona?",OTHELLO
,"Well, my good lord.",DESDEMONA
,"Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.",OTHELLO
,It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.,DESDEMONA
,This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:,OTHELLO
,"Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires",OTHELLO
,"A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,",OTHELLO
,"Much castigation, exercise devout;",OTHELLO
,"For here's a young and sweating devil here,",OTHELLO
,"That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,",OTHELLO
,A frank one.,OTHELLO
,"                  You may, indeed, say so;",DESDEMONA

,A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;,OTHELLO
,"But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.",OTHELLO
,"I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.",DESDEMONA
,"What promise, chuck?",OTHELLO
,I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.,DESDEMONA

,I am a child to chiding.,DESDEMONA
,"What's the matter, lady?",IAGO
,"Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.",EMILIA
,"Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,",EMILIA
,As true hearts cannot bear.,EMILIA
,"Am I that name, Iago?",DESDEMONA
,"What name, fair lady?",IAGO
,Such as she says my lord did say I was.,DESDEMONA
,He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink,EMILIA
,Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.,EMILIA
,Why did he so?,IAGO
,I do not know; I am sure I am none such.,DESDEMONA
,"Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!",IAGO
,"Hath she forsook so many noble matches,",EMILIA
,"Her father and her country and her friends,",EMILIA
,To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?,EMILIA
,It is my wretched fortune.,DESDEMONA
,Beshrew him for't!,IAGO
,How comes this trick upon him?,IAGO
,"Nay, heaven doth know.",DESDEMONA
,"I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,",EMILIA
,"Some busy and insinuating rogue,",EMILIA
,"Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,",EMILIA
,Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.,EMILIA
,"Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.",IAGO
,"If any such there be, heaven pardon him!",DESDEMONA
,A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!,EMILIA
,Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?,EMILIA
,What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?,EMILIA
,"The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,",EMILIA
,"Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.",EMILIA
,"O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,",EMILIA
,And put in every honest hand a whip,EMILIA
,To lash the rascals naked through the world,EMILIA
,Even from the east to the west!,EMILIA
,Speak within door.,IAGO
,"O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was",EMILIA
,"That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,",EMILIA
,And made you to suspect me with the Moor.,EMILIA
,You are a fool; go to.,IAGO
,"O good Iago,",DESDEMONA
,What shall I do to win my lord again?,DESDEMONA
,"Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,",DESDEMONA
,I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:,DESDEMONA
,"If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,",DESDEMONA
,"Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,",DESDEMONA
,"Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,",DESDEMONA

,"To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,",DESDEMONA

,I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.,RODERIGO
,What in the contrary?,IAGO
,"Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;",RODERIGO
,"and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me",RODERIGO
,all conveniency than suppliest me with the least,RODERIGO

,"Will you hear me, Roderigo?",IAGO
,"'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and",RODERIGO
,performances are no kin together.,RODERIGO
,You charge me most unjustly.,IAGO
,With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of,RODERIGO
,my means. The jewels you have had from me to,RODERIGO
,deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a,RODERIGO
,votarist: you have told me she hath received them,RODERIGO
,and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden,RODERIGO
,"respect and acquaintance, but I find none.",RODERIGO
,Well; go to; very well.,IAGO
,"Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis",RODERIGO
,"not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin",RODERIGO
,to find myself fobbed in it.,RODERIGO
,Very well.,IAGO
,I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself,RODERIGO
,known to Desdemona: if she will return me my,RODERIGO

,"unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I",RODERIGO
,will seek satisfaction of you.,RODERIGO
,You have said now.,IAGO
,"Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.",RODERIGO
,"Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from",IAGO
,this instant to build on thee a better opinion than,IAGO
,"ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast",IAGO
,"taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I",IAGO
,"protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.",IAGO
,It hath not appeared.,RODERIGO
,"I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your",IAGO
,"suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,",IAGO
,"Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I",IAGO
,"have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean",IAGO
,"purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if",IAGO
,"thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,",IAGO
,take me from this world with treachery and devise,IAGO
,engines for my life.,IAGO
,"Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?",RODERIGO
,"Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice",IAGO
,to depute Cassio in Othello's place.,IAGO
,"Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona",RODERIGO
,return again to Venice.,RODERIGO
,"O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with",IAGO
,"him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be",IAGO
,lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be,IAGO
,so determinate as the removing of Cassio.,IAGO
,"How do you mean, removing of him?",RODERIGO
,"Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;",IAGO
,knocking out his brains.,IAGO
,And that you would have me to do?,RODERIGO
,"Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.",IAGO
,"He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I",IAGO
,go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable,IAGO
,"fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which",IAGO
,"I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,",IAGO
,you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near,IAGO
,"to second your attempt, and he shall fall between",IAGO
,"us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with",IAGO
,me; I will show you such a necessity in his death,IAGO
,that you shall think yourself bound to put it on,IAGO
,"him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows",IAGO
,to waste: about it.,IAGO
,I will hear further reason for this.,RODERIGO
,And you shall be satisfied.,IAGO
,"I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.",LODOVICO

,forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.,OTHELLO
,"I will, my lord.",DESDEMONA
,How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.,EMILIA
,He says he will return incontinent:,DESDEMONA
,"He hath commanded me to go to bed,",DESDEMONA
,And bade me to dismiss you.,DESDEMONA
,Dismiss me!,EMILIA
,"It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.",DESDEMONA
,"Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:",DESDEMONA
,We must not now displease him.,DESDEMONA
,I would you had never seen him!,EMILIA
,"So would not I	my love doth so approve him,",DESDEMONA
,"That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--",DESDEMONA
,"Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.",DESDEMONA
,I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.,EMILIA
,"All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!",DESDEMONA
,"If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me",DESDEMONA
,In one of those same sheets.,DESDEMONA
,"Come, come you talk.",EMILIA
,My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:,DESDEMONA
,"She was in love, and he she loved proved mad",DESDEMONA
,And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;',DESDEMONA
,"An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,",DESDEMONA
,And she died singing it: that song to-night,DESDEMONA
,"Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,",DESDEMONA
,"But to go hang my head all at one side,",DESDEMONA
,"And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.",DESDEMONA
,Shall I go fetch your night-gown?,EMILIA
,"No, unpin me here.",DESDEMONA
,This Lodovico is a proper man.,DESDEMONA
,A very handsome man.,EMILIA
,He speaks well.,DESDEMONA
,I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot,EMILIA
,to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.,EMILIA
,"[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,",DESDEMONA

,"Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?",DESDEMONA
,It's the wind.,EMILIA
,[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what,DESDEMONA

,"Sing willow, willow, willow:",DESDEMONA
,"If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!",DESDEMONA
,"So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;",DESDEMONA

,"Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--",DESDEMONA
,That there be women do abuse their husbands,DESDEMONA
,In such gross kind?,DESDEMONA
,"There be some such, no question.",EMILIA
,Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?,DESDEMONA
,"Why, would not you?",EMILIA
,"No, by this heavenly light!",DESDEMONA
,Nor I neither by this heavenly light;,EMILIA
,I might do't as well i' the dark.,EMILIA
,Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?,DESDEMONA
,The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.,EMILIA
,For a small vice.,EMILIA
,"In troth, I think thou wouldst not.",DESDEMONA
,"In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had",EMILIA
,"done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a",EMILIA
,"joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for",EMILIA
,"gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty",EMILIA

,monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.,EMILIA
,"Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong",DESDEMONA
,For the whole world.,DESDEMONA
,Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and,EMILIA
,"having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your",EMILIA

,I do not think there is any such woman.,DESDEMONA
,"Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would",EMILIA
,store the world they played for.,EMILIA
,But I do think it is their husbands' faults,EMILIA
,"If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,",EMILIA
,"And pour our treasures into foreign laps,",EMILIA
,"Or else break out in peevish jealousies,",EMILIA
,"Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,",EMILIA

,"Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,",EMILIA
,Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know,EMILIA
,Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell,EMILIA
,"And have their palates both for sweet and sour,",EMILIA
,As husbands have. What is it that they do,EMILIA
,When they change us for others? Is it sport?,EMILIA
,I think it is: and doth affection breed it?,EMILIA
,I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?,EMILIA
,"It is so too: and have not we affections,",EMILIA
,"Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?",EMILIA
,"Then let them use us well: else let them know,",EMILIA

,Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.,RODERIGO

,I have no great devotion to the deed;,RODERIGO
,And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:,RODERIGO
,"'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.",RODERIGO
